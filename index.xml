It arrived packed well, but the hard drive was dead. I cracked it open, and swapped the drive, but no joy. I tried another drive, and even from the option-boot screen, the Mini didn’t see the drive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I booted from several install discs, and none worked. In a fit of masochism, I even booted into Open Firmware, but couldn’t get that to work either. I plugged a USB IDE drive sled into my Mac Pro, and restored the Tiger DVD to it…. nope. Mini couldn’t see it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>PowerMac G4</title><link>/archives/1960/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/1960/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’m writing this on a PowerMac “Mirrored Drive Door” G4, running Classilla browser on MacOS 9.2.2.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was built in or around 2002, and lived at a printing company until they closed at the end of last year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I sought out a MDD G4 specifically, as it is the last G4 that can boot MacOS 9. From what I’ve read, Apple produced it, grudgingly, to appease designers and musicians who didn’t want to migrate thousands of dollars’ worth of software and hardware to OS X.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Working on a $5 Raspberry Pi</title><link>/archives/1956/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/1956/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’ve held off from buying a Raspberry Pi Zero for a while, in favor of Teensy or Pro Micro controllers, because what can a $5 controller really do?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’ve been pleasantly surprised with the Zero so far. $5 got me a computer that’s half the size of a credit card, with HDMI video out, two USB ports, a GPIO header, and WIFI. Frickin’ WIFI!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Performance-wise, well, it’s pretty slow. But it’s fast enough for prototyping and running LEDs, which is great for my current project.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Jobs</title><link>/archives/1954/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/1954/</guid><description>&lt;p>How can I answer my kid when he asks what he should be when he grows up, when the job I have wasn’t invented when I was a kid?&lt;/p>

At least, there used to be, before the reality TV shows made everyone think they could get rich quick. The unit was crammed with old boxes and some furniture. The furniture caught my eye — a refinished vintage desk from the fifties or sixties could sell for quite a bit. The crowd was sparse, and I won the auction for a steal. After the auction, I drove the box truck back to my warehouse, and began unloading it. My warehouse was a small prefab metal building with a roll-up garage door that my father had used, when he was alive, to store junk in, and to dream about building race cars. To my knowledge, no car had ever graced the concrete floor of that building.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Reclamation</title><link>/archives/1927/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Aug 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/1927/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>Posted to Reddit as “I found something while cleaning out a hoarder’s house”&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’d been working reclamation for a little over a year. We called it reclamation, but that’s a euphemism for ‘throwing away crazy people’s shit’. I work for CLK, one of the largest property owners in the Southeast.

The stupid fourteen year old DRDRED43 refused to move away from the turret, and I was getting destroyed. The game stuttered for a moment, and my connection dropped. “Fucking Comcast,” I muttered, and shoved back from my desk. My phone buzzed again. “God dammit, Jesse.” I sighed, shoved my feet into some sandals, and walked out the door.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Battery Room</title><link>/archives/1922/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/1922/</guid><description>&lt;p>“Lowest man on the totem pole.” That’s how my boss described it. That’s how I got stuck on night shift. That made me “The New Guy”. Or “TFNG”, as my coworkers said during the two weeks of day shift training I got at the start of the job. I’m a junior network administrator, right out of college, riding on a friend of a friend’s recommendation. I was responsible for making sure everything stayed the same over night — all the little red lights stayed red, and the green lights stayed green. I had very little idea what I was doing, but in government work, the one thing you can count on is that the task is documented somewhere. Usually on paper, in a binder. I’d done PC tech support for a few years during college, but had never worked with network gear before. If my résumé isn’t outright false, it definitely stinks of cheese.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Audra</title><link>/archives/1914/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Mar 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/1914/</guid><description>&lt;p>Audra forgot to lock her laptop that morning. We had been dating for about four years, and living together for three. I was happy, had been happy, and I truly thought everything was fine. She left for her Saturday run in the park, and I stayed behind, content to play video games on my lazy weekend morning. When I went to the kitchen, my cat, which had been sleeping on the laptop keyboard, got up and meowed at me. I noticed then that the screen was unlocked. I pushed the cat out of the way, and sat down, thinking I would ensure the cat hadn’t made a mess of anything. Then I noticed an instant message window. “I love you too!”&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Witches and The Circle</title><link>/archives/1906/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Nov 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/1906/</guid><description>&lt;p>My great-aunt had died the year before. Her house was locked up in probate until issues of inheritance were settled. My father was acting as caretaker of the property, which meant I took care of the place while my old man bought booze with my great-aunt’s money. I didn’t mind; it got me out of my place, away from my old man, and it made a nice place to have parties and hang out with my friends. My friend Chris loved the place. I think he also needed a place to hide, somewhere away from his own house with all of his dead mother’s things lying around, right where she left them, before a sleep-deprived truck driver snuffed out her life like a candle on a store-bought birthday cake.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Gap In The Wall</title><link>/archives/1887/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Sep 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/1887/</guid><description>&lt;p>My name is China Westerson. China, like the country, not the dinnerware. I am nearly nineteen, and I am haunted. You might think it strange that I say that I am haunted, instead of saying, perhaps, I live in a haunted house, or I have seen a ghost. There’s a difference. When you’re haunted, it follows you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I grew up in Mobile, Alabama, in my great-uncle John’s ancient Greek Revival, and it was a haunted house. Nothing too impressive; objects would move when you weren’t looking, doors that you had closed on the way out would be open upon returning home. We liked the ghosts of that house. They seemed like family, and according to my great-uncle, a few were. Old houses always have ghosts, he said. They have ghosts just like they have wood rot, plumbing problems, and bad wiring.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Thing On The TV</title><link>/archives/1884/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Sep 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/1884/</guid><description>&lt;p>When I was about thirteen, I stayed at my uncle’s house over the summer. I didn’t know it, but my parents were getting divorced and they wanted me to have a fun summer without dealing with the stress of moving. I loved my uncle’s place, so I was thrilled to find out that I would get to stay there all summer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My uncle’s house was not very pretty, a big old farmhouse with peeling yellow paint, but the farm was amazing. I was from the city, and my house barely had a yard, much less twenty acres of fields and forest, and a creek that ran through it all. At first, my favorite thing to do was to simply run through those fields, as hard as I could, until I was so hot and exhausted I thought I might pass out, then jump into the cool waters of the forest-shaded creek.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Side Tunnel</title><link>/archives/1881/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 May 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/1881/</guid><description>&lt;p>I hated that town. Sprawled across the rotting foothills of a dead mountain chain, the city was a mass of Old South racism and corruption, filled with inhabitants too poor or too sentimental to leave for someplace better. The city sweltered in the mid-summer heat, smog from traffic mixing with lethal amounts of pollen and dust to form a soup that killed asthmatics as effectively a whiff of mustard gas.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Delivery</title><link>/archives/1876/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Feb 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/1876/</guid><description>&lt;p>I saw him for the first time in the freezer. It was late on a Friday night, really Saturday morning, and I was moving food to the cooler for the morning crew. I pulled a box from the shelf and turned, and there, right there by the door, he was standing. A dark shape — no, a dim shape, fuzzy in those few seconds of vision, my eyes not quite certain if they were focusing on the freezer door or this thing in front of it. Pale arms outstretched and raised towards me. Hollow eyes black against a pallid face, and a mouth that opened as if to speak. I heard the click and slide of tongue on teeth, underneath the low wheeze of the freezer fan. And he was gone.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Methenes Chapel</title><link>/archives/1872/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Feb 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/1872/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Goat roared down the dusty country road, shattering the silence of the late October twilight. The Goat was a 1969 Pontiac GTO “Judge”, Ram Air and a Rock Crusher transmission. Jay had painted it a glowing, canary “arrest me” yellow, and he had mounted a goat skull on the dash. “You wanna see Methenes Chapel?” Jay shouted at me over  the roar. “Sure,” I said. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>We were college roommates, both nineteen, weird, into heavy metal, goth, industrial, and false occultism. We both knew our inverted pentagrams were fake, but it surely offended the normals in those small, rural Alabama farming communities. One of our favorite activities was ghost-hunting, which to us meant driving to supposedly haunted locations and acting out our own developmentally-challenged “Beavis and Butthead” episodes. &lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Mug</title><link>/archives/1874/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Feb 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/1874/</guid><description>&lt;p>“Whose mug is this?” Becky asked. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>“No idea,” I replied. “What are you talking about?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“This mug right here,” she said. I leaned back in my chair and craned my neck to see. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>“I’m trying to watch this show,” I said. “What’s the big deal about a mug?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“I’ve never seen it before,” Becky said, getting that tone in her voice like I was about to be in trouble.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“So what? You collect cups and mugs like most people … er, don’t,” I said. If I was going to be in trouble, I might as well go for broke.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Other One</title><link>/archives/1870/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Feb 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/1870/</guid><description>&lt;p>Sometimes things do not go as planned.

&lt;p>The big dumb deputy got Jim in the back, about a minute in. By then there was smoke in the air, screaming, lots of noise. I always knew Jim would die of a bullet, most likely in the back. I think he knew the same. I should have known that the sheriff would post a deputy at the bank. It made no sense. We had spent the previous night torching the Canaveras Ranch, shot old man Canaveras, shot his ranch hands, shot the wife and children. Let one run to town with a hole in her arm, in her bloody nightgown, so as to attract attention back to the ranch. Then we rode hard around the Gap to town, and waited until the kid rode up, nearly dead, screaming and hollering about murder. &lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Space Between</title><link>/archives/1862/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Nov 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/1862/</guid><description>&lt;p>Can a house be evil?

&lt;p>There’s not a lot of work out there for a twenty-ish ex-security guard with a bad case of PTSD.

I don’t feel like I’m a nosy person. No more nosy than the next guy. I just have what my Ma would call an unhealthy amount of curiosity. I was the kid who climbed to the top of the big oak in the back yard, just to see what was in the crows’ nest. I was the kid who dug a hole in the back yard so deep that I hit groundwater because I was convinced there was a cave under our house, and I wanted to see it. To see.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Directional Shift</title><link>/archives/1846/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Jul 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/1846/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’ll be posting short stories here, as they’re written.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Phil Windley’s Technometria | Fixing MacBook Pro Sleep Problems</title><link>/archives/1844/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/1844/</guid><description>&lt;p>Here’s how to fix your Macbook Pro’s &lt;a href="http://www.windley.com/archives/2007/10/fixing_macbook_pro_sleep_problems.shtml">busted sleep function&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Stuff Insurance</title><link>/archives/1842/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/1842/</guid><description>&lt;p>In the mad rush to consolidate two households into the smaller of two houses — and that location being hopefully only temporary — we’ve been trying to get rid of a whole lot of Stuff.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Macbook Pro’s drive was partitioned as an Apple Partition Map, legacy from the G4 Powerbook. Leopard won’t install on APM for Intel systems.

They say they could probably make another one even smaller and cheaper: about the size of a pack of gum for less than $50.

&lt;p>Fairly often in my career, I’ve started a job as an additional sysadmin, or worse yet, a replacement sysadmin. I rarely have the luxury of setting up a system or a network from scratch. It’s always difficult to determine the security level of a given system, and I rarely [never] have been able to treat production systems as “untrusted” and take them down long enough to do a full audit.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>GNU grep’s new features</title><link>/archives/1781/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jun 2006 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/1781/</guid><description>&lt;p>Among other things, &lt;a href="http://www.linux.com/article.pl?sid=06/05/19/1920231">GNU grep&lt;/a> now supports color.&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>In one scene, the unstoppable Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones) bashes through wall after wall, until a naive Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page) slows him down by sinking him into the floor. The angry mutant declares, “I’m the Juggernaut, bitch!” and then continues on his quest, but the brief line sticks out glaringly in an otherwise vulgarity-free film. “When that line comes up, I’m probably going to start breakdancing, and Randy will scream out the phrase himself,” 21-year-old college student Xavier Nazario said excitedly, thrilled over the prospect of watching Jones utter the line made popular by an Internet spoof Nazario released last February. Using an old “X-Men” cartoon, Nazario and pal Randy Hayes dubbed their voices in, giving birth to the now-famous catchphrase. Hayes, who voiced Juggernaut’s ghetto persona in the top-rated &lt;a href="http://youtube.com/watch?search=i%27m+the+juggernaut+bitch&amp;amp;v=k4qdX6_9XgI">YouTube.com clip&lt;/a>, isn’t quite so shocked that Ratner paid tribute to the clip. “Everybody loves the Juggernaut,” he laughed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Banana Phone</title><link>/archives/1779/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 May 2006 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/1779/</guid><description>&lt;p>Ring ring ring — &lt;a href="http://cellfoam.com/">BANANA PHONE&lt;/a>!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Shortly after WWII a guy named Art Lacey (he had a British wife) went to Kansas to buy a surplus B-17. His idea was to fly it back to Oregon, jack it up in the air and make a gas station out of it. He paid $15,000 for it. He asked which one was his and they said take whichever you want because there were miles of them. He didn’t know how to fly a 4 engine airplane so he read the manual while he taxied around by himself. They said he couldn’t take off alone so he put a mannequin in the co-pilot’s seat and off he went.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Meditation On the Speed Limit</title><link>/archives/1765/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Feb 2006 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/1765/</guid><description>&lt;p>Here’s why driving the speed limit — 55MPH — on I-285 in Atlanta is a &lt;a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-5366552067462745475&amp;amp;q=meditation+speed">bad idea&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Watch Porn</title><link>/archives/1764/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Feb 2006 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/1764/</guid><description>&lt;p>No, not “View Porn”.&lt;/p>

The theater is gorgeously designed with a Arabian theme, and inside the theater itself, the seating and stage is under a sky-blue ceiling that gives the impression of being in a Arabian mosque near sunset — complete with twinkling stars.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Phantom” was also quite good; I’m not a big fan of musicals, but the show was very engaging, and the stagecraft was excellent.

&lt;p>The filter can be made from terra cotta clay mixed with coffee grounds, molded into a cup-like shape, then fired in a manure-pile.

&lt;p>It’s fairly good as a launcher — better than most, but it still gets confused by multiple matching Start Menu items. For example, if you type ‘FIR’, intending to launch Firefox, AppRocket will show you multiple instances of Firefox: one for “All users”, and one for your account. Overall, the program is no &lt;a href="http://quicksilver.blacktree.com">Quicksilver&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It still would’ve been a keeper had it not been ninja-payware. Nowhere on the AppRocket webpage or on the download page is anything listed about how the app will self-destruct after about a month if you don’t buy it. I’ve checked all around the site and still see nothing about this auto-expiry.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Gas Prices</title><link>/archives/1695/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Apr 2005 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/1695/</guid><description>&lt;p>This &lt;a href="http://www.atlantagasprices.com/index.aspx?s=Y&amp;amp;fuel=A&amp;amp;area=Smyrna&amp;amp;station=All%20Stations&amp;amp;tme_limit=36">site&lt;/a> shows a stack-ranked list of gas prices, low to high, for the Atlanta area.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Squick</title><link>/archives/1694/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Apr 2005 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/1694/</guid><description>&lt;p>Thanks to this &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;amp;q=kayvan%20porn">Disturbing Search Request&lt;/a>, I’ve got some horrible mental images I’ll have to scrub out of my brain for the next few hours.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>With Teeth</title><link>/archives/1693/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Apr 2005 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/1693/</guid><description>&lt;p>Trent Reznor is releasing a new &lt;a href="http://www.nin.com/">nine inch nails&lt;/a> album in a few days, titled “with teeth”.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As it turns out, NewsFire’s developer, Dave Watanabe, has decided to start charging $20 for it. My problems with this are many:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>NewsFire really isn’t worth $20. It’s an RSS reader. My toilet has an RSS reader, these days. It might be worth $5.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>There was never any indication that NewsFire was going to be shareware. There was just a prompt to upgrade, and a minor mention of a “registration” system in the release notes.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>There’s no real improvement over the existing, working 0.62 version.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/beta.php">NetNewsWire Lite&lt;/a> does the same thing, and is free.
I’m not sure which drugs Mr. Watanabe is on. Gone are the days where a developer can give a marginally-better-than-the-competition application away for free, then arbitrarily decide to start charging for the next version. Particularly when Tiger’s version of Safari will support RSS feeds natively within a few months.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>

The cashier then called her by her last name, and asked her for her phone number, which the girl glady gave.

&lt;p>MT-Blacklist did nothing to help me, during the comment-spam attack. The botnet connections occurred regardless of blacklisting.

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Web: Safari — I’m a Safari fanatic, and really only for its speed and its synced bookmarks.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>IM: &lt;a href="http://adiumx.com">Adium&lt;/a> — I’m a sucker for tabbed interfaces, and this slick, tabbed, multi-protocol chat app is the best around.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.newsfirerss.com/">NewsFire&lt;/a> — As I’m sure you’ve read, Newsfire rox my pants. I’ve tried others, and I still think it’s the best.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Address Book.app — this is an indespensible app for me, especially combined with Quicksilver.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Phase B Complete</title><link>/archives/1000/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Oct 2004 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/1000/</guid><description>&lt;p>Phase B is now complete!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The import from MT to WP went very quickly. The only ‘gotcha’ is that PHP hates importing text files of over 1MB (unless you screw with the php.ini settings), so I had to manually split the import.txt file into several smaller chunks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As you can see, a few minor cosmetic glitches remain. I’m still not sure what’s up with the post title, but I’ll work on that later.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Phase One Complete</title><link>/archives/999/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Oct 2004 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/999/</guid><description>&lt;p>Phase One of the move to WordPress is complete: all MT entries are imported, and the site is mostly active, although the main Index redirector still sends people to the MT page.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I’ll be switching to &lt;a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress&lt;/a> this weekend.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you use MoveableType, I seriously recommend removing it &lt;em>today&lt;/em>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Eliminate iTunes’ Stutter</title><link>/archives/997/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Oct 2004 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/997/</guid><description>&lt;p>iTunes stutters. Y-Yu-Y-You heard me. It didn’t always do this, though. When I first ran iTunes on my PC, it was a wondrous revelation… but recently, probably after a software update, it developed a stutter. I got fed up tonight and searched until I found the answer buried in an Apple messageboard, away from Google’s prying eyes. The culprit: DirectSound.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yes, Apple is now using Microsoft’s pitiful DirectSound via QuickTime to play iTunes music. I don’t know if it’s always been this way (I don’t think so), but the way to remedy the stutter is to close iTunes, open QuickTime preferences, and change the ‘Sound Out’ from DirectSound to something more reasonable, like ‘Wave Out.’ Close QuickTime Preferences, open iTunes, and poof! Stutter banished.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>More OSX goodies</title><link>/archives/996/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Oct 2004 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/996/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://projects.tynsoe.org/en/geektool/" title="Tynsoe projects">GeekTool&lt;/a> is a nice little prefpane applet that lets you display time-refreshed unix command outputs or Internet-based images on your desktop.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I tried out Bloglines with the &lt;a href="http://bloglines.com/about/notifier#mac">OSX notifier&lt;/a>, and was less than impressed. I like the persistency of a web-based aggregator, but I hate pretty much everything else.

&lt;p>Today, though, I discovered &lt;a href="http://www.newsfirerss.com/" title="NewsFire. Mac RSS with Style.">NewsFire&lt;/a>. Holy crap, this thing is cool. The UI is very slick and very easy to use, with good, intuitive keyboard shortcuts, and the whole app is very integrated into the OS.

&lt;p>osx2x’s problems were many: the PC would detect a / as a ?, and vice versa; the number pad wouldn’t work, and sometimes the shift key would get stuck. Worse, it was impossible to play games on the PC and span over to the Mac’s monitor — osx2x would either completely garble the mouse commands, or would just crash. I had to put a KVM in place just so that I could switch the hardware keyboard to the PC when I wanted to game.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Firefox and RSS Feeds</title><link>/archives/992/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Sep 2004 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/992/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’m really impressed with the latest version of &lt;a href="http://mozilla.org">Firefox&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In singleplayer Doom3, you play alone. In COH, you can play alone, but you get the best gameplay experience playing in a group.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Doom3 is very predictable, with the same monsters spawning in the same places at the same time, every time. COH missions &lt;em>can&lt;/em> be linear, in that certain bosses will always appear in certain missions, but in general the mobs are different every time.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>iPod Infrared Remote</title><link>/archives/978/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jul 2004 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/978/</guid><description>&lt;p>Here’s how to turn your iPod into a &lt;a href="http://features.engadget.com/entry/6336778455600767/" title="How-To Turn your iPod in to a Universal Infrared Remote Control">Universal Infrared Remote Control&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Please allow four to six weeks for results.</title><link>/archives/977/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jul 2004 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/977/</guid><description>&lt;p>Through the magic of the Interweb, &lt;a href="http://fury.com/">Kevin Fox&lt;/a> discovered a photo of &lt;a href="http://fury.com/images/weblog/google_circa_1960.jpg" title="Google">Google, circa 1960&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Eeep.</title><link>/archives/976/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jul 2004 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/976/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.fotolog.net/anythinggreat/?pid=8056553" title="anythinggreat`s Fotolog">O_O&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Goonies Locations</title><link>/archives/975/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jul 2004 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/975/</guid><description>&lt;p>Here’s a list of some of the locations filmed in “&lt;a href="http://www.thegoonies.org/locations.htm" title="The Goonies">The Goonies&lt;/a>“.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>HTML Nerdery</title><link>/archives/973/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jul 2004 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/973/</guid><description>&lt;p>And so I won’t forget, here’s a list of &lt;a href="http://www.bbsinc.com/symbol.html" title="ISO Latin 1 Character Entities and HTML Escape Sequence Table">ISO Latin 1 Character Entities and HTML Escape Sequence Table&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mutt Still Sucks</title><link>/archives/972/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jul 2004 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/972/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.rc0.org.uk/mairix/" title="Mairix">Mairix&lt;/a> is super-fast mail-indexing app that might convince me to use &lt;a href="http://mutt.blackfish.org.uk/">Mutt&lt;/a> instead of my beloved &lt;a href="http://www.washington.edu/pine/">Pine&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In a nutshell, Quicksilver is a command-key-activated launcher. Hit cmd-space, type ‘CALC’, hit enter, and it will launch Calculator.app.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What makes Quicksilver truly great is its ability to catalog all of your applications and their preferences, your favorites, your contacts, and so on. This means that Quicksilver isn’t restricted to launching your apps — type in ‘UNXM’ and it will open your &lt;a href="http://unxmaal.com">favorite website&lt;/a>.

&lt;p>A lot of people have complained that the MINI is too loud for long trips, that the ride is too rough, especially on run-flats, and so on. I haven’t noticed any of that, probably because my senses were dulled by four years of Ford Escort. possibly not, though, because Laura noted how quiet it was inside the car with the windows up. Bumps that were very jarring in the Escort are still noticeable in the MINI, but only on an ‘informational’ level — it doesn’t feel like serious structural damage is taking place when I drive over a small pothole.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Self-Signed Certs and AIM</title><link>/archives/954/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Apr 2004 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/954/</guid><description>&lt;p>Here’s how to &lt;a href="http://secure.sylikc.net:8080/self_signed/">generate and use self-signed certs&lt;/a> for use with AIM.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I agree with Warren: get a Bluetooth-enabled phone, such as the Sony Ericsson T610. It’s excellent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I use a tiered ‘mobility’ system:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It seems to me that the better way of blocking comment spam would be to use a modified version of Realtime Blackhole Lists.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The downside of RBLs for email have been the fact that if you use them, you must rely solely upon the judgement of their maintainers. There is an implicit trust in the maintainers of the RBL, that they won’t block the entire continent of Asia just because of a few Tawainese spammers. Unfortunately, many RBL maintainers have, in the past, blocked whole major networks, just to “get attention”. This had the effect of wiping out email for enormous chunks of the Internet. Since most webloggers want to encourage commenting, this is not the result we want.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>iTunes is free software</title><link>/archives/910/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Oct 2003 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/910/</guid><description>&lt;p>Windows users, listen up:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The reason for this is obvious after thinking about how the proxies work. The site mentions that some of these anonymize your traffic and thats true.

&lt;p>Suggestion for WSX3:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>MIPed windows should [do something] when their dock icon is clicked. Right now I can’t decide what that something is; I think that perhaps a double-click should maximize all of them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>MIP iTunes, and open Safari. Now, consider your mouse movements. In order to maximize the MIPed iTunes, if the Safari window hides the iTunes MIP, you must first either cmd-tab to iTunes or click the icon, then click the MIPed window. Thus your mouse at worst travels from the center of the screen to the bottom of the screen, then almost to another edge of the screen, just to maximize a MIPed window.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mold</title><link>/archives/894/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2003 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/894/</guid><description>&lt;p>Saturday, &lt;a href="http://unxmaal.com/cgi-bin/clickcount.cgi?action=jump&amp;amp;URL=http://abracapocus.org/">Laura&lt;/a> told me we had mold in the hallway.

&lt;p>Historically, the Catholic Church often used the process of inculturation, or the adaptation of indigenous pagan beliefs into traditional Church teachings.

&lt;p>While the gypsy pilgrimage, or Pelegrinage Gitane, to Saintes-Marie-de-la-Mer has been ostensibly a Catholic celebration for many centuries, the roots of the religious belief may stretch much farther east.

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>N.A.G.

Type in one or more search keywords, and N.A.G. looks for matches on the Gnutella peer-to-peer file sharing network. The software then downloads MP3 files which match the search keyword(s) and remixes these audio files in real time based on the structure of the Gnutella network itself.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Things That Never Were</title><link>/archives/876/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jul 2003 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/876/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://unxmaal.com/cgi-bin/clickcount.cgi?action=jump&amp;amp;URL=http://www.onceinoticediwasonfireidecidedtorelaxandenjoythefall.org/merkabah/">Matt Rossi&lt;/a>‘s long-awaited first novel, “Things That Never Were”, is now available for &lt;a href="http://www.monkeybrainbooks.com/Things_That_Never_Were.html">pre-order&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pocket Pool</title><link>/archives/875/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Jul 2003 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/875/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last week, my swimming pool had become a deep green, indistinguishable from the color of the murky waters of the Chattahoochee, so I decided to invest in some more pool chemicals.

&lt;p>&lt;em>Indeed, modern evolutionary theory is very respectful of the power of death. After all, in that theory it is death that prunes and directs the otherwise boundlessly chaotic, mutable explosive flow of life. Death is the mechanism of selection, death the means by which certain mutations are deemed fit to survive and be passed on to future descendants. The tension between the urge to procreate and the possibility of dying before passing one’s genetic information forward to be combined and developed is what, according to Darwin and his disciples, helped create that massively diverse biosphere in the first place. Taken still further, there are schools of thought that regard evolution as punctuated by bursts of sudden adaptation which may well be explainable as the influence of sudden drastic shifts in environment placing additional selective pressure on life…in essence, the death rate goes up because a rock falls from space or continental drift changes the climate, and as the deaths pile up the remaining life forms are pared down to a few hardy forms, which then explode into new forms as soon as the playing field is stable enough to be exploited. Whether you view life as a closed cycle that can only bear so much before necessary collapse or a fractal with the potential to expand indefinitely, it’s clear that death provides a necessary service in simultaneously producing fodder for future expansion and allowing room for new development by carving stagnation away.”&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>MoveableType</title><link>/archives/852/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Apr 2003 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/852/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’ve just moved the site to &lt;a href="http://moveabletype.org">MoveableType&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A very cool feature of NetNewsWire is that it periodically checks the feeds to which you’ve subscribed, and if it finds something new, it will download the headline and notify you.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Correct VNC Ports</title><link>/archives/850/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Mar 2003 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/850/</guid><description>&lt;p>(Because I always forget)&lt;/p>

The word is a combination of “landscape” and the Greek word “xeros,” which means “dry.” The primary goal of Xeriscaping is to create sustainable landscapes that require a minimum of water, while still remaining attractive.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>“The &lt;a href="http://www.tiho-hannover.de/einricht/phys/ag_schemann/">enteric nervous system&lt;/a> is an independent nervous system embedded in the wall of the gut and is also referred to as the “little brain of the gut”. With 100 million neuronal cell bodies the gut brain containes more nerves than the spinal cord. It is in its true sense an autonomous nervous system which has the capability to control gut functions independent of inputs from the central nervous system. The gut is therefore the only organ which exhibits all vital motor functions and reflexes even when isolated. The capability for autonomous control is due to the fact that the enteric nervous system contains its own set of sensory neurones, interneurones and motorneurones and is functionally and structurally very similar to the brain. In recent years the clinical relevance of the pathophysiology of the enteric nervous system has been recognized and together with continous progress in basic research a new discipline called “Neurogastroenterology” has emerged.”&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>West Wing</title><link>/archives/803/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Dec 2002 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/803/</guid><description>&lt;p>To &lt;a href="http://unxmaal.com/cgi-bin/clickcount.cgi?action=jump&amp;amp;URL=http://blog.ghostdragon.net/">Nyx&lt;/a>, regarding a &lt;a href="http://www.televisionwithoutpity.com/story.cgi?show=4&amp;amp;story=1718&amp;amp;page=10&amp;amp;sort=&amp;amp;limit=all">West Wing recap&lt;/a> she was trying to get me to read at 4 AM:&lt;/p>

After he painted the room with my greasy entrails the first time, I discovered that he was, indeed, easy to beat. The very simple trick is to jump up onto one of the ledges on the sides of the room, stay fairly still, and shoot the hell out of him. He’ll continue to occasionally turn into a huge ball and squash you, but at most he’ll only take off a hundred points. The ledge keeps you out of the way of his freezing attack. Also, it’s a lot easier to keep a target lock on him while you’re standing still.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Free Education</title><link>/archives/797/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2002 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/797/</guid><description>&lt;p>In response to &lt;a href="http://unxmaal.com/cgi-bin/clickcount.cgi?action=jump&amp;amp;URL=http://blog.ghostdragon.net/">Nyx&lt;/a>‘s fine &lt;a href="http://www.ghostdragon.net/MT/mt-tb.cgi?__mode=view&amp;amp;entry_id=4588">post&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I am highly suspicious of anything ‘free’ [[TAANSTAFL][3]]. I am especially cautious of ‘free’ education. It is, more often than not, less &lt;em>education&lt;/em> and more &lt;em>indoctrination&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>While on vacation a few weeks ago, I signed up for an AOL dialup account so that Laura and I could suckle from the Internet’s great digital teat. Since I no longer need the account, I decided to cancel it today. This should’ve been easy. Instead, it’s very similar to cancelling a membership to a nation-wide gym.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, it is quite impossible to find any customer-service contact number via their external website, &lt;a href="http://www.aol.com">www.aol.com&lt;/a>. I suppose they never planned on people having alternate connectivity. I actually had to ask someone who used AOL to locate the number for the Cancellation Hotline, which in turn was very well-hidden.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Palladium</title><link>/archives/781/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Oct 2002 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/781/</guid><description>&lt;p>Yesterday, I found a highly interesting analysis of Microsoft’s Palladium.

Section Z was like the poor-man’s version of &lt;a href="http://www.nintendoland.com/home2.htm?reviews/nes/metroid.htm">Metroid&lt;/a>: guy in a space-suit killing things in order to kill a bigger ‘Brain’ thing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The one important thing about this game was that it taught me how to non-linearly map things. I was used to pen-and-paper RPGs, so I was used to drawing areas that had rooms that lined up. After a few days of frustration trying to map Section Z, I realized that it didn’t matter where I put the rooms on my map. At the end of each room there were two teleporters. The key to mapping [and beating] the game was to note where the teleporters took your character. By the time I was done with the game, I had dispensed with graph paper, and just had a list of section names and where their ‘up’ or ‘down’ teleporters took me.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>monkey loves OSX</title><link>/archives/779/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Oct 2002 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/779/</guid><description>&lt;p>Even &lt;A HREF="http://dinkdonk.com/misc/funny/switch/monkeyswitch.mov">the monkey loves Mac OSX&lt;/A>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The L0rD’s Pr4y3R</title><link>/archives/778/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Oct 2002 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/778/</guid><description>&lt;p>As seen on &lt;a href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot&lt;/a>, the L33t Sp34k “L0rD’s Pr4y3R”:&lt;/p>

The manual is nonexistent, and the ‘About’ page degenerates into an existentialist rant, so I’ll explain the application:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Zo??? is a Java application that acts as a self-contained POP3/IMAP client. It can download copies of your email from your mailserver(s), and can also import your stored mails from your current system (if said email is stored in an mbox format). It then indexes all inbound email, and generates a webpage that shows a concise view of important info, such as a timeline view, all hyperlinks in the emails you’ve received for x day, all people who’ve mailed you that day, and all the attachments you’ve gotten. Even better, it allows you to do a google-like search on that email. Zo??? also acts like an SMTP server, in that it can index your outgoing mail as well: configure your regular mail client to send mail through localhost:10080, and Zo??? will nab outgoing mails, index them, and forward them on to the regular SMTP server.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Robert’s Camera</title><link>/archives/775/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Oct 2002 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/775/</guid><description>&lt;p>Robert: “I’m trying to charge the batteries in my camera and it’s doing something I’ve never seen it do before.”&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The problem with security is that, depending on your level of paranoia, no method is safe.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The CIA-approved methods of destroying disk data include pulverizing the hard disk platters and then burning them. Even then it is hypothetically possible to recover data from burned chunks of hard drive media, if the recovering organization has enough resources and the will to do so. For example, if you’re concerned about the Illuminati recovering your info, chances are they already have it, or they’ll use their super secret MKULTRA mind assassins to haunt your house and capture your data with spirit familiars.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dreamcast broadband redux</title><link>/archives/764/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Sep 2002 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/764/</guid><description>&lt;p>YES! &lt;a href="http://www.ncsx.org">NCSX&lt;/a> is going to do another batch of dreamcast Ethernet cards.

&lt;p>The main problem with the config file for ircd is that it was written by computer nerds in the 70s, so the config files go something like “By default we disallow all access. If for some weird reason you actually want someone to be able to USE your server, you’ll have to edit the Y line. The format for editing the Y line consists of rolling 6d8 [using standard D&amp;amp;D dragon dice], multiplying that result in octal by the hex value of &lt;em>e&lt;/em>, and then placing colons after every second prime number in the result. Append that with your users’ expected Class rating. [Class ratings are not covered in this document, and the appropriate document may be found via Gopher at the University of Helsinki’s site. Or not.]”&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Rod’s Bday</title><link>/archives/750/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Aug 2002 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/750/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hooray!

Devices that plug into the main machine often have additional connector ports, which in turn serve to connect other devices. A camera plugs into a keyboard that is home to a mouse, and the keyboard connects to the G4 tower. Rather than the monolithic PC tower, where adding a peripheral requires turning off the system, removing panels, and socketing new cards, the Apple peripherals and systems sprout and sprawl like living things across and through the desktop.

&lt;p>There is a fundamental hypocrisy in demanding changes of an inherently Socialist educational system. By definition, a State-run school will have very little direct oversight by the populace, but will instead exist as any other Socialist entity: as a jobs program, and most importantly as a way to perpetuate its own existence as a State institution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By submitting to a State-run institution, a person may not pick-and-choose by which rules he will abide. If the State dictates that person swear allegiance to a god or a flag in which he does not believe, that person must swear so, based on that person’s prior, implicit submission.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bloginality</title><link>/archives/724/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jun 2002 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/724/</guid><description>&lt;p>W00t!

&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Download and install the Apple Developer Kit. It’s a pretty hefty install at around 500MB, but you’ll need it for the Darwin C compiler, cc.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Download and install &lt;a href="http://mrcla.com/XonX/">X11&lt;/a> for OSX.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Download and install the &lt;a href="http://wrench.et.ic.ac.uk/adrian/software/oroborosx/">OroborOSX&lt;/a> window manager.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Download and installFink&lt;a>. &lt;/p>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>
 5. Finally, download and install &lt;A href="http://finkcommander.sourceforge.net/">FinkCommander&lt;/a>.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
 FinkCommander is an excellent, indispensible GUI interface for the command-line Fink package manager. It allows you to update your installed Unix packages at the touch of a button, and to search for new packages by name or by keyword.

&lt;p>Applescript can be used to very easily mount SMB shares. Open /Applications/Applescript/Script Editor, and paste in the following script (change the variables to match your setup):&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;tt>&lt;/p>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
 tell application "Finder"
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
 open location "smb://user:password@computername/sharename"
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
 end tell
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
 &lt;/tt>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
 Save the script as an application, and be sure to check &amp;#8220;Do not show startup screen.&amp;#8221; This will yield a clickable item that will behave like any other app, and can be used to quickly connect to an SMB share.

Now I can use my iBook to gain dialup out-of-band access to routers. Bwahaha!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Updating G4 Firmware</title><link>/archives/715/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jun 2002 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/715/</guid><description>&lt;p>Over the weekend, I learned how to update the firmware on my G4 server. The poor thing was running Firmware version 4.1.old, and didn’t know about booting straight into OS X via holding the ‘x’ key at boot, network boot, or Firewire Target Mode.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since the only Mac I’ve ever owned came with OSX, I’ve had no real use for Classic in any real sense, so I chose not to install it on this system. Once I downloaded the firmware updater, I found it would only run from OS 9.x (Classic). I’d never done a Classic installation before, but it wasn’t very difficult, with the exception of a few snags.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blue People</title><link>/archives/714/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jun 2002 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/714/</guid><description>&lt;p>The &lt;a href="http://www.people.virginia.edu/~rjh9u/blkysc82.html">Blue People&lt;/a> of Troublesome Creek, Kentucky, are a group of people living in a small, relatively isolated area who all have varying shades of blueness to their skin. Dr. Madison Cawein researched the anomaly and isolated it to a recessive gene that caused the an absence of the enzyme diaphorase. Diaphorase converts converts methemoglobin, the blue, oxygen-depleted form of hemoglobin, back to the hemoglobin that gives oxygenated blood a red color.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Rod Rocks!</title><link>/archives/713/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jun 2002 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/713/</guid><description>&lt;p>Woot!

This box is typically stable, but over the past few months things have gotten rather wonky. I’ve been meaning to rebuild this thing on FreeBSD 4.5, which I’ve been using at work for some time now. Package management under FreeBSD is much more mature than anything I’ve tried under linux, so I think I’ll generally have fewer headaches about internet services when I have one less linux box to worry about.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Am???lie</title><link>/archives/711/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jun 2002 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/711/</guid><description>&lt;p>Today, in honor of &lt;a href="http://unxmaal.com/cgi-bin/clickcount.cgi?action=jump&amp;amp;URL=http://www.mindspring.com/~morgaana/">Laura&lt;/a>‘s new haircut, we went to see &lt;a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0211915">Am???lie&lt;/a>. My recommendation: ignore its French-ness. Ignore its subtitles. Go see this movie. It’s worth your while. Am???lie is the rarest form of film: funny without being stupid, smart without being pretentious, visually deep without requiring a &lt;a href="http://www.beowulf.org">Beowulf&lt;/a> cluster.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>True, there’s no girl out there who’s quite as ingenuous as Am???lie, but the movie does a good job at playing on my need to &lt;em>believe&lt;/em> that there’s someone like her in the world. Sometimes, like at 3:45 on a Sunday morning, it’s important to have such beliefs.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ryoji Ikeda</title><link>/archives/710/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 May 2002 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/710/</guid><description>&lt;p>For a few months Robert and I have debated deleting these two obscure and indefineable albums.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The machine came with a 500 MHz PowerPC 7400 (G4) processor with the AltiVec “Velocity Engine” vector processing unit and 1 MB of backside cache, 340 MB of RAM, three 18.0 Ultra2 LVD SCSI hard drives, an ATI Rage 128 Pro, and a SCSI DVD-Rom drive.

&lt;p>Today I had “diced chicken with red peppers”, and when they say “red peppers”, they really mean it. The food itself was excellent, and the buttered &lt;a href="http://barbeque.allrecipes.com/az/naan.asp">naan&lt;/a> bread was absolutely wonderful. Overall, the little restaurant was very clean and tidy, and the service was very quick. A meal will costs more than fast food, at around $10 a plate, but the large portions and wonderful flavorings are well worth the price. If you’re in North Atlanta and looking for Indian cuisine, I highly recommend you stop by.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Shower Shock Soap</title><link>/archives/708/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 May 2002 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/708/</guid><description>&lt;p>Now I can get my morning caffeine hit via my &lt;a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/stuff/caffeine/5a65.shtml">soap&lt;/a>.

&lt;p>With &lt;a href="http://labs1.google.com/sets">Google sets&lt;/a>, you enter a few related items, and Google will attempt to find more items in that set. For example, I listed several industrial bands: VNV Nation, Nine Inch Nails, Skinny Puppy, Laibach, and Coil, and Google returned this &lt;a href="http://labs1.google.com/sets?hl=en&amp;amp;q1=vnv%2520nation&amp;amp;q2=laibach&amp;amp;q3=coil&amp;amp;q4=skinny%2520puppy&amp;amp;q5=nine%2520inch%2520nails&amp;amp;btn=Grow+Set">expanded set&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another nice Google &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/help/operators.html#site">feature&lt;/a> eliminates the need to wait on sites with slow or nonexistent search functions. In Google’s search box, append site:sitename to your query, and Google will only return results from that site. For example, if you enter your query as “site:www.orbyn.com hair fudge” (note no http://), you’ll get an interesting result from &lt;a href="http://unxmaal.com/cgi-bin/clickcount.cgi?action=jump&amp;amp;URL=http://www.orbyn.com/">Robyn&lt;/a>‘s page, as well as giving her lots of interesting search referrals.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>56 Players</title><link>/archives/705/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2002 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/705/</guid><description>&lt;p>So, what do you do if you have 56 Quake 3-playing friends and a lot of time on your hands?&lt;/p>

I told the cashier to inform his management that the arbitrary hold-time due to the large cash purchase just cost Compusa about $200. The cashier then stated that his management was much happier about the large cash purchase and wasn’t very concerned about the loss of $200.

I guess having these numbers stored in my phone is good, as it means there’s one less group of facts that I have to remember, but it does suck when I forget to charge the battery.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pine Commands</title><link>/archives/681/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Apr 2002 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/681/</guid><description>&lt;p>I heart Pine.

Instead, oil is produced by bacteriological processes deep within the Earth’s crust. This concept answers several questions with the current concept of oil generation, such as: “how can there be oil on asteroids, if there were no organic matter to make it from?” “Why do dry wells fill up?” “Why can we find oil literally anywhere on the planet if we drill deep enough?” “How could there possibly have ever been enough biological matter present under the exact conditions necessary to produce oil?”&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Transformers</title><link>/archives/675/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Apr 2002 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/675/</guid><description>&lt;p>Oooh: the DVD boxed set of the &lt;a href="http://www.us.buy.com/retail/product.asp?sku=40167357&amp;amp;loc=14010">Transformers&lt;/a> first season is on sale for about $50.

&lt;p>First, I’ll admit I have a degree.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, it’s in Geography. I really enjoy the field, but I don’t want a job in it. GIS sucks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Meanwhile, I used my spare time during college to immersively study PCs and networking. Now I work for a large Internet backbone access provider.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From what I’ve seen here, in this cube farm, all of the people in 5th level have degrees [in CS], and are paid very well to know what they’re doing. Most of the people in 4th level have degrees [some in English or Art History], but even the ones who don’t have degrees are very skilled, and have every intention of obtaining a degree. In my own group, most of the techs have degrees, but again, they may not be directly related to networking.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Soundboards</title><link>/archives/651/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Mar 2002 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/651/</guid><description>&lt;p>Have your friends ever received a phone call from Miss Cleo?

She was friendly about the correction, so Megan asked the question that unlocked our “pop” mystery: “Hey, we really like the Coke at McDonald’s. Is there something you guys to do make it so good?” The manager teased us about not being able to disclose it, trade secret and whatnot, but she eventually told us…&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>dsu remote fullrate</title><link>/archives/639/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Mar 2002 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/639/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hey kids! On most &lt;a href="http://www.cisco.com">Cisco&lt;/a> routers, “dsu remote accept” is enabled by default! This means that if you’re paying for a fractional DS3 from your upstream service provider, and you have the right type of router on your side, you can issue the command “dsu remote fullrate” to crank that fractional DS3 up to a full 45MB! Even better, your upstream provider will likely not notice, giving you hundreds of thousands of dollars of bandwidth for free! What’s more, if your provider notices, Cisco will consistently tell them that “that command is probably not enabled by default,” but Cisco isn’t sure, because they’ve “never tested it in a lab!”&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>GBA Light at portable monopoly</title><link>/archives/640/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Mar 2002 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/640/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://PortableMonopoly.net">PortableMonopoly.net&lt;/a> Is taking orders for the GBA FrontLights.

&lt;p>Adium is a free AIM client, written by &lt;a href="http://homepage.mac.com/adamiser/">Adam Iser&lt;/a>.

The installation was (as always, on OS X) drag’n’drop simple, and the configuration options are very thorough. My install takes up a total of 2.5mb of drivespace, and in its idle state the app uses roughly 0% CPU load. If you’re interested in how it works, the author has released the program under the GPL, and has the source code freely-available on his site.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Angstrom</title><link>/archives/627/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Mar 2002 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/627/</guid><description>&lt;p>What is an &lt;a href="http://liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/Academy/UNIVERSE/angstrom.html">angstrom&lt;/a>?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Nanotubes</title><link>/archives/628/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Mar 2002 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/628/</guid><description>&lt;p>More small things: The &lt;a href="http://www.pa.msu.edu/cmp/csc/nanotube.html">Nanotube&lt;/a> site.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Inside OSX</title><link>/archives/626/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Feb 2002 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/626/</guid><description>&lt;p>Mmm hardcore geek reading: Apple’s “&lt;a href="http://developer.apple.com/techpubs/macosx/Essentials/SystemOverview/">Inside OSX&lt;/a>: System Overview” is on my to-do list.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Progress Quest</title><link>/archives/625/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Feb 2002 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/625/</guid><description>&lt;p>Tired of spending hundreds of hours wasting your time on some RPG game?

True, some attempts at solving a problem may appear to be “simple solutions”, when they actually cause more problems than they solve. Solution complexity appears to scale with the complexity of the problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I learned this maxim at an early age. I got my first Rubik’s Cube when I was eight. I immediately mixed it up, thinking I could solve the problem. Unfortunately, I had no interest in mathematics, and very little patience. I promptly tossed the scrambled cube into the toy box and forgot about it for a few years. When I rediscovered it, I had this genius idea: I could pry the pieces of the cube apart, and reassemble the cube in the correct order. Given a screwdriver and five minutes, and I had a properly-arranged Rubik’s Cube. Sure, I didn’t solve the problem according to the guidelines listed on the box, but at age nine, I could care less about the methods of my solution.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Construx</title><link>/archives/611/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Feb 2002 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/611/</guid><description>&lt;p>When I was a kid, I used to build really neat things with &lt;a href="http://www.go-to.de/sign/tg/tgwa/inhalt/werbung/FisherPrice/FP05.html">Construx&lt;/a>.

&lt;p>True, my primary reason for keeping this site around is that it serves as a universally-accessible bookmarks page. When I find something interesting, I post about it. There are, of course, other reasons.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I read or heard, somewhere, something, that said that no thought can truly be considered complete until it has left the mind, converted to another medium, such as text or speech or art. This sounds odd at first, but consider how truly difficult it is to express yourself verbally. You can think of amazing things, but the act of converting these thoughts to static text or spoken words takes a significant effort. These simple few lines, for me, contained numerous backspaces and word-replacements that narrowed my original thoughts into precise verbiage.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>CIA Spook Lady</title><link>/archives/603/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jan 2002 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/603/</guid><description>&lt;p>The CIA Spook Lady is the cashier at a local Chinese buffet.

&lt;p>The RIAA considers copyright &lt;a href="http://www.riaa.com/Copyright-What.cfm">more important&lt;/a> than the 1st Amendment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hilary Rosen, president of the RIAA, likes to have sex with &lt;a href="http://www.advocate.com/html/stories/837/837_rosen01.asp" title="But hey, who doesn't?">women&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The RIAA has &lt;a href="http://www.riaa.com/MD-US-7.cfm">explained&lt;/a> why CD prices are still so expensive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The RIIA now wants legal authority to &lt;a href="http://www.fuckedcompany.com/extras/riaa_email.cfm">hack&lt;/a> into your personal computer&lt;/a> to look for illegally-obtained media.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.islandx.ca/weblog.shtml">X&lt;/a> writes &lt;em>“I’m all for the suppression of popups – because they’re annoying as hell and companies that use them should damn well know better – but suppressing banner ads deprives the sites of needed revenue, which in turn helps force ’em out of business that much faster, which in turn means we get ad-free surfing but nothing to look at.”&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, I feel this software fixes severe security holes in Internet Explorer, holes that can be easily exploited by malicious website owners. Second, supressing banner ads via a locally-owned and operated piece of software prevents one person from seeing those ads: me. To my knowledge, I have clicked one banner ad in the last three years. I did not buy anything after I clicked it. Therefore, there is zero revenue to be gained from me. Even if I did see the ad, I wouldn’t buy the advertised product, thus the ad image is simply wasted data that I’ve involuntarily downloaded to my PC. As my PC is my personal property, to do with as I choose, I choose not to waste my resources downloading things I don’t want. Third, it is not my responsibility to keep websites in business. It’s nice that there are websites to look at. However, if these sites cannot come up with a business model that will allow them to stay operational, tough. This is called business in the real world. If all the content-providing, interesting to look at sites all shut down because nobody clicked on their casino/hotteensex ads, I’ll go read a book.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>AdShield</title><link>/archives/492/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Oct 2001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/492/</guid><description>&lt;p>I highly recommend &lt;A HREF="http://www.adshield.org/">AdShield&lt;/A>.

&lt;p>Just for kicks, he went to some Nightmare-difficulty PlayerKiller dueling games and started taunting people.

&lt;p>In Tim’s world, the Internet is run by evil “negative thinkers” out to destroy humanity. How quaint.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why do people still listen to what ‘famous’ people have to say? Tim Burton may be a great director, but that does not implicitly guarantee him the background and education to make sweeping statements about anything outside his field of expertise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fame does not equal genius, as we see cases like Rosie O’Donnell. I remember the drama majors from high school and college: they were usually the ones too self-obsessed or insipid to absorb any real knowledge, seeking instead to reproduce the work of others onstage for their own gratification.

I’ve always had an implicit understanding that there was no real Mariah Carey, as there is no real Michael/Janet Jackson, or a real Britney Spears.

When parts of their bodies touch a surface, woodlice slow down and will eventually stop if enough of their body comes into contact with an object or another woodlouse (thigmokinetic response). This type of behaviour will cause clumping of woodlice as they come into contact with each other as they explore their habitat. This clumping will result in an overall reduction in the surface area to volume ratio of the group (compared with individuals) and this will lead to a reduction in the rate of water loss.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Digital Sundial</title><link>/archives/402/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jul 2001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/402/</guid><description>&lt;p>A &lt;A HREF="http://www.middlebury.edu/~schar/sundial/patent.html">Digital Sundial&lt;/A> displays the current solar time in digits, words, or pictures. Two closely-spaced parallel masks project different images depending on the angular position of the sun in the following way: The first mask, a regular array of thin vertical slits, casts a striped light pattern onto the second mask. This light pattern is independent of the height of the sun. The second mask is composed of narrow stripes of the digits, words, or pictures to be displayed. The striped pattern of sunlight cast by the first mask illuminates exactly those stripes of the second mask corresponding to the image representing the current time. The light shining through both masks is projected onto a translucent viewing screen mounted closely behind the second mask, which results in a digital display of the time. A plate of light-refracting material can be inserted between the two masks, effectively linearizing the motion of the light pattern cast onto the second mask. Using this linearized version, it is possible to construct not only a sundial displaying the hours, but also a minute display which, for example, repeatedly displays the minutes of the current time in five-minute intervals.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cellfone Jammers</title><link>/archives/401/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jul 2001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/401/</guid><description>&lt;p>Woohoo!

I open the door, jump back to let the blast of hot air pass, jump in the car, start it, turn the AC on HIGH, roll down the windows, drive out of the apartment complex really fast so the engine assists the compressor, then roll up the windows. By the time I’m on the highway to work, it’s fairly comfortable.

&lt;p>Best Buy’s scam is that they supposedly charge a little less than their competitors. Suppose you purchase something for $200. When you get to the register, they push this ”service plan” of an extra $40. This obviously jacks the price up far more than their competitors’ prices. Now, if you don’t purchase their service plan, and your purchase breaks after 1 month, tough. Their stupidly stringent policy denies you any refund, exchange, or repair. You will not get your money back, or be able to return the broken device.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Shelli</title><link>/archives/367/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Jun 2001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/367/</guid><description>&lt;p>When did &lt;A HREF="http://www.girlskickassracing.org/">Shelli&lt;/A> make her own site, and why wasn’t I paged?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Time travellers</title><link>/archives/366/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jun 2001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/366/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hey kids!

AOL is trying to kill interoperability of other messaging systems with AIM. So far &lt;a href="http://gaim.sourceforge.net/index.shtml" target="_blank">GAIM&lt;/a> and Jabber have occasionally been able to work around the restrictions, but AOL keeps moving the targets. I strongly suspect that in so doing they have broken their own official clients. If they’re going to play that way, I don’t want to play with them.

&lt;p>When I turned it on, all I saw on the screen were alternating vertical lines. I replaced the batteries, backed up my software, did soft resets, hard resets, to no avail. I finally called Palm Tech Support, who didn’t answer any questions and merely wanted me to fork over $100 for repair. By this time, I’d already taken the case off, so I declined their kind offer. I found the ribbon cable that goes from the board to the display, and shoved it back into its socket. I put the case back on, replaced the batteries, and it started up, as good as new.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Muppets!</title><link>/archives/122/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Feb 2001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/122/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img decoding="async" src="images/woot.jpg" />&lt;img decoding="async" src="images/googlykelly.jpg" />&lt;br>

&lt;p>After confirming with the Flight Commander, Marsha started SoftPhone and at approximately 4:09PM made a call to the Flight Director. The call went from her SoftPhone software through a VG-200 gateway, over an FXO port, through a PBX to the phone on the Flight Director’s desk. At the end Marsha called one of the &lt;a href="http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/cc/pd/tlhw/prodlit/7960_ds.htm">Cisco 7960 phones&lt;/a> in the Payload Operations Center, which was answered by Brett Parrish, lead NASA engineer on this project.

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>icqateima32.dll (removes advertisement downloading)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>icqateimg32.dll (removes the loading of images)&lt;br>

&lt;p>This weekend’s new concepts:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://www.4woodblinds.com/">Wood Blinds&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>: I noticed a sign, while driving through Atlanta, that said “Wood Blinds.” At first I thought, “Advertisement for window coverings.” Then I thought, hey, what if this is really a public service announcement, as in “Drugs Kill” ? Maybe these people are trying to do us a favor: Wood blinds! I relayed this epiphany to the group, and they concurred that there were many ways that wood could blind. Splinters, flying sticks, and even chopsticks can rob hapless children of their sight. Remember, kids: &lt;strong>&lt;blink>Wood Blinds&lt;/blink>&lt;/strong>.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Kayvan&lt;/strong>: Kayvan’s name sounds like a unit of measurement. “Captain, the Amphilons are at 3500 Kayvans and closing!” We’re not sure, but we think that Kayvan is about six feet tall. If Kayvan is six feet tall, how far away is Huntsville from Atlanta, in Kayvans? Answer: a little over two Megavans, which is a &lt;em>bunch&lt;/em> of Kayvans. And you know what to do with a buncha Kayvans. &lt;/blockquote>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

I’m particularly interested in future timelines that are constantly modified to account for current events. Two such timelines are presented by &lt;a href="http://kurellian.tripod.com/spjrm.html">J. R. Mooneyham&lt;/a>: The aptly-named “&lt;a href="http://kurellian.tripod.com/spint.html">Timeline&lt;/a>“, and “&lt;a href="http://kurellian.tripod.com/spprs0.html">Perspectives&lt;/a>“.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>The Timeline is a general outline of future history, and somewhat conservative and circumscribed in what it offers the reader. The Timeline is meant to be the ‘harder’ of the two works, in terms of science and predictions. But this also means the Timeline must be more generalized, more risk-averse– and also peter out entirely as we venture into the deep, deep future, where everything must ultimately give way to outrageous guesswork (partly due to technology advancing to levels indistinguishable from magic, as a famous quote by Arthur C. Clarke suggests).&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Alt-X</title><link>/archives/40/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/40/</guid><description>&lt;p>“Since &lt;a href="http://www.altx.com/">Alt-X&lt;/a>‘s inception in 1993, our primary mission has been to challenge both the art and literary publishing establishments by supporting some of the most iconoclastic voices and visions in the international art world. “&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Dennis Wingo, head of Huntsville, Alabama-based SkyCorp, wants to fling modified &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com">Macintosh&lt;/a> G4 Cubes into space, where they’ll become part of a communications satellite constellation used for webhosting and email. The G4-turned-satellites will communicate with the ground with modified versions of the Apple Airport wireless-data device.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sure, it’s a wacko idea, but I like the concept of using lots of dirt cheap, off-the-shelf components to supplant roles commonly held by extremely expensive singular ones. Extending this concept, I’d like to see a satellite constellation made up of hundreds of thousands of Palm-Pilot-sized devices that cost less than $20 to manufacture. If one burns up, who cares? This concept also bears curious resemblance to that of the “localizer” that I posted about &lt;a href="http://unxmaal.com/?2000_11_26_archive.htm#1487797">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Plague Domes</title><link>/archives/42/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/42/</guid><description>&lt;p>Yes, kids, it’s true: you too can own your own little piece of the &lt;a href="http://www.plaguedomes.com/">Apocalypse&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>exoskeletons</title><link>/archives/37/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Jan 2001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/37/</guid><description>&lt;p>For Christmas next year, I fully expect someone to get me a &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_1112000/1112411.stm">military grade exoskeleton&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Retro-Remakes</title><link>/archives/38/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Jan 2001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/38/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.retro-remakes.com/">Retro-Remakes&lt;/a> is a nice little classic-gaming site that serves as a repository for new versions of older games.

This topic came up in discussion a few weeks ago with Rod and ubergenius &lt;a href="http://omnilegent.org">Alan Booker&lt;/a>, and Alan suggested I look into inline water heaters. The idea behind inline water heaters is that since you only use hot water at a few places, there is no need to have a huge tank heating water all the time. With an inline heater, you add multiple units where they are needed (kitchen and bathroom), and they turn on when you turn on the faucet. The best part: this means you get unlimited hot water (or until your electricity runs out).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Action Figures</title><link>/archives/21/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jan 2001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/21/</guid><description>&lt;p>With the help of &lt;a href="http://www.andgor.com/Personalized_Figures/personalized_figures.html">these guys&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://shadowstitch.com">Kevin&lt;/a> could get his Action Figure created and marketed a lot quicker.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The important part lies in one of the last paragraphs:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Nor are MP3 recordings necessarily illegal: “There are hundreds if not thousands of legal MP3s on the `Net,” Ron Boire, [president of Sony Electronics’ Personal Mobile Products company] said.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>“Hundreds if not thousands” of legal MP3s? Let me calculate, for a moment. I own about 200 CDs, and I converted them all to about 2400 &lt;em>legal&lt;/em> MP3s and keep them on my PC at home. I also have remote access into my home machine, so I can listen to them at work. Since my PC is technically part of the Net, according to Mr Boire I own just about ALL of the MP3s on the Internet. I feel so special.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>woops</title><link>/archives/15/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jan 2001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/15/</guid><description>&lt;p>I honestly didn’t know that Saturday was &lt;a href="http://www.astrogeek.net/">Heather&lt;/a>‘s birthday.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>They’d just gotten back from a short vacation to New Orleans, and when my stepdad opened the door to the house, he smelled gas. He didn’t feel it was safe to go inside, so they went to a service station and called the gas company. They waited for the gas co rep for an hour, then decided that he might have gone straight to their house, so they went back home. By the time they got home, the roof had blown off the house, and the insides were gutted by fire.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>medical palms</title><link>/archives/13/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jan 2001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/13/</guid><description>&lt;p>My sister and her fiance Terry are both nurses, and Terry’s considering getting a &lt;a href="http://www.palm.com">Palm Pilot&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

I ooo’d and aaah’d and drooled over this game back in the day when it was on the arcade.

Go &lt;a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/mandm/ProductInfo.asp?ProdType=movie&amp;amp;ST=10228165">buy&lt;/a> this today and get to wastin some quality time in front of the tube!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>/archives/1517/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Nov 2000 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/1517/</guid><description>&lt;p>These &lt;a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2000/11/20/MN62513.DTL&amp;amp;type=science">smart dust&lt;/a> devices bear curious resemblance to devices discussed in Vernor Vinge’s novel, &lt;a href="http://www.iplus.zetnet.co.uk/nonfiction/deepness.htm">&lt;em>A Deepness In The Sky&lt;/em>&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In “Deepness”, these devices are known as “localizers”, and with their limited distributed computation, surveillance, and movement abilities, they prove to be a cornerstone of space-faring civilization. With a cloud of localizers in a microgravity environment, construction becomes a matter of simplicity, as a single person can easily manage many independent objects at once. For more info, go buy the book.

Yeah, this means zilch to you, with your big site and a million visits a day, but to me, with my meager 80 visits a day, it’s bigtime.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>/archives/1454/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Oct 2000 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/1454/</guid><description>&lt;p>OK… I love my pet..

&lt;p>This is no surprise to me. When I was in high school and had no car and no social life to speak of, I sat in my room and played Tetris for hours on end, until every shape I saw I would figure out how to fit a Tetris shape into it. It got bad. I was a Tetris junkie. Couldn’t live without it. I only got over it by passing the Gameboy on to my dad, who would then become a Tetris addict for the next two months, then pass it back to me, whereupon we would start the whole, vicious Tetris cycle over again.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>/archives/1479/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Oct 2000 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/1479/</guid><description>&lt;p>come chill at MC Hawkings &lt;a href="http://www.mchawking.com/">crib&lt;/a>!&lt;br>

&lt;font size="1">In the handy “petite” size.&lt;/font>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;font size="1">&amp;amp;nbsp&amp;amp;nbsp&amp;amp;nbsp&amp;amp;nbsp&amp;amp;nbsp Okay, kids. Maybe it’s just the fact that my little Virtua On Hardware experiment didn’t go entirely as planned, but I’m was in a pretty foul mood when my good friend Markham sent me a link to this place, aptly named, &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.iloveholly.com">Iloveholly.com.&lt;/a> But before you click that link, and grace the site with another ‘hit, read the following rant.&lt;br /> It’s yet another little ego-stroke website, put up by yet another cute little social deviant/elitist chick. The web seems to be overflowing with beautiful people who want the world to know their unique wisdom, and more importantly, see them. (for a small fee, of course) And they believe that they are honestly worth it… I’m sure it couldn’t be further from the truth. (Of course, the reader will automatically assume that the following smacks of unrequited lust or jealousy or both, and even though this is not the case, feel free to believe whatever you like.) I’m so sick of people thinking we want to see gallery after gallery of photos of them. In rare cases, when they’re getting nekkid, this is fine, but for the most part, the pics I speak of are blurry, ill-angled webcam shots that give people an excellent idea of the encroachingly deformed mass of your forehead, or a blurry idea of your physique from a meter or two away. It only gets worse when they ask people to pay them for the privelege. You give them money, and maybe, once or twice a week at predetermined times, you see them sitting in front of their computer, doing whatever they do. (personally, I would love to have my own cam, and charge people to watch me sit at my computer and bite my fingernails and drink sprite. There’s an idea, corporate sponsorship…) This irks me to no end, ESPECIALLY when they have such a high opinion of themselves that they feel the need to glut their page with a hundred thumbnails of themself, from said webcam. Most of the time, people like that are convinced they are pretty. They know it. They’re vain creatures, deep within whatever outer candy shell they’ve created to show the world. (and I’m sure if you asked them, they’d tell you that isn’t the case.) If you email them to tell them how much you like their site, they’re going to automatically assume it’s because you think they’re attractive. If you write them hate mail, they’ll think the same thing. Their sites exist for the sole reason of egotism, and that’s going to be the foremost thought in their mind when they read the comments about said website. &lt;br />The more I become acquainted with people in general, the more I realize that the beautiful people are meat. They have properly categorized themselves as useless, yet attractive “things.” Like a lamp or a chair. They are things that are pretty to look at, and they are self-servient in their roles, giving the rest of us something to stare at. When people read playboy, do they really CARE what the models’ hobbies are? In the “Miss Indeterminate Landmass” competitions, do we CARE about the girls’ “talents”? It seems that people who are not necessarily outright stunning in their appearances have real personalities to make up for the fact that they can’t attract people by the sheer force of their bodily attractiveness. Which is not to say that there is a direct inverse proportion between beauty and wit; I won’t even open &lt;b>that&lt;/b> can of worms…but that one finds when one can’t beguile with a wink, that one must resort to …other methods of coercion. Ones that require thought and forethought, planning and preparation, wit and wile.&lt;br /> Anyways, there was no real point to this rant, no major epitome I was trying to reveal, it was just because I hate those sites, and I felt that you should too. Now, if you feel you &lt;b>must,&lt;/b> go back up to the top, and click the link to see the site in question. And bear in mind, which would you rather see? The girl in question’s disjointed journal (detailing her fascinating life of shopping, drinking, and socializing.) or her gallery of photographs, (in which she prances around quite often in varying degrees of nudity)….&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>/archives/1415/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Sep 2000 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/1415/</guid><description>&lt;p>Welllllll, whaddaya know?

By the time the films are finished — the first one is due out by the end of 2001 — Weta will have 200 processors dedicated to rendering. &lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>/archives/1417/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Sep 2000 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/1417/</guid><description>&lt;p>Don’t tell &lt;strong>&lt;em>ME&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> that there aren’t any &lt;a href="http://jesus.com">good men&lt;/a> left out there.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>/archives/1419/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Sep 2000 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/1419/</guid><description>&lt;p>Unfortunately, due to the fact that the little bugger kept begging me for food until I fed him all the food in his food box, with no source of renewal in sight, my Seaman starved to death.&lt;/p>

Although I’m pretty sure no one has it personally, keep an eye out; I need a copy of &lt;em>“Suzuka 8 Hours”&lt;/em> for the Super Nintendo.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of my little toys is a SNES Disk Backup/Rom Emulation system, that can do a lot of stuff, but not special chipset rendering.&lt;br>
So games like Starfox, Super Mario Kart and Pilotwings don’t work on it. But with a special auxilary card that contains the DSP chipset, it will play them just fine.&lt;br>
Someone informed me tonight that Suzuka 8 Hours has what amounts to an open-access DSP chipset in it. For all intents and purposes, this supposedly causes it to function like a DSP plugin card. I didn’t believe the concept at ALL , so I tested it with Super Mario Kart.&lt;br>
Now, SMK will lock up upon starting a race, when loaded from diskette. But I tried loading it from diskette while I had the game itself in the slot normally reserved for the plugin card (but not accessed in ANY way by the game ROM) and suddenly it worked.. it was a bit glitchy… but the system was getting minor usage of the DSP chipset in the Super Mario Kart Cartridge….&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>/archives/1429/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Sep 2000 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/1429/</guid><description>&lt;p>Minor updates today: moved those goofy ICQ things to their own goofy little box.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This release proves that Mozilla has finally reached a level of stability that competes with IE, and I’m truly impressed. I’d installed Mozilla M15 a while back, and promply uninstalled it about five minutes later.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What I like about Mozilla:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>It’s fast. No, I mean, it’s &lt;em>very&lt;/em> fast. Pages load considerably faster in M17 than in IE5.5 .
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>It’s small, weighing in at about six megs.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>It has full PNG graphics support, including transparency.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The security and privacy features are wonderful! Mozilla allows you to disable cookies completely, or allow them to be set, providing they are only sent back to the originating server. Furthermore, Mozilla allows this same amount of control over &lt;em>images&lt;/em>. This means that you can disable all images that aren’t stored on the website you’re currently viewing, such as banner ads. Furthermore, you can control this on a per-site basis, from the “Tasks -&amp;gt; Security and Privacy” menu.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Mozilla is skinnable. You can change the interface whenever you want.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>When you view a page’s source, it shows it in pretty color-coded text. &lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>/archives/1359/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Aug 2000 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/1359/</guid><description>&lt;p>Conversation overheard in my house:&lt;/p>

You have to access that part and feel deep down inside that BSD is in fact technically superior to Linux. Even just a little bit. And you don’t have to tell anyone.&lt;/em>“&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>/archives/1377/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 2000 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/1377/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>A conversation online:&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Are we reaching a new level of consequence?&lt;br>
With the rise of trackable communication, I’ve seen more and more abuses of courtesy, starting with CallerID and extending to the Net at large. When CallerID was first introduced, woe be to those who misdialed a number, for they could be sure to receive an angry return call from whichever repressed moron disturbed from watching Geraldo by an accidental phone call. It appears with the spread of Instant-Message clients to the masses, the insipid and stupid have gained this technology as well, and are abusing it just as they have abused telephone products.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>/archives/1236/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Jul 2000 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/1236/</guid><description>&lt;p>For everyone who has ever wondered what the real meaning is behind the anime-that-kicks-you-in-the-head-yes-even-more-than-Akira, &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.advfilms.com/catitem.html?c=all&amp;#038;k=ev001" >Neon Genesis Evangelion&lt;/a>, check out &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.toastyfrog.com/jump/or-thumbnail/evatt-26.shtml">Toastyfrog’s Summary of Eva Episode 26&lt;/a>, which is basically a overly artsy-fartsy Hideaki Anno getting symbolic on our asses.&lt;br>

&lt;p>Good question. Carnivore is supposedly designed to be a sniffer, checking all inbound and outbound packets and forwarding those from badguys to the Feds. Um, guess what, people… routers do this all the time. That’s what routers do: look at packets and decide where they go. As Cringely says, “&lt;em>adding the Carnivore task is a simple matter of blind copying every packet to or from a bad guy to a third address at the J. Edgar Hoover FBI Building in Washington, DC. It’s at most a few lines of code and requires no additional hardware.&lt;/em> ”&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>/archives/1253/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jul 2000 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/1253/</guid><description>&lt;p>Can I congratulate Kevin yet?

&lt;p>I’m trying to move to Huntsville, VIA U-haul. So I called to reserve a truck for this weekend, and the guy at the place I call explains that they are booked up through the weekend. So…I call the next number in the list of U-haul dealers, and it turns out to be the same guy. I repeat my question, and he repeats politely that they are all booked. I’m satisfied with this, and go to the next number on the list. No answer. So I go to the next number. Disconnected. I go to the next number, and damned if I don’t get the same guy as the first two numbers. So, I decide to try and get a truck next week. I say, “I’d like to inquire about renting a truck?” And he says “WE ARE BOOKED.” and hangs up on me.&lt;br>
I proceed to call back and ask to speak to his manager, whom I chew out about his employees’ rude behavior, and explain to him in very colorful terms exactly WHY I will NOT be renting ANYTHING from “Grand Rental Station,” ever.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>/archives/1145/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jun 2000 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/1145/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.shotgunrules.com/" target="_blank">The Official Shotgun Rules Homepage&lt;/a> Now everyone can read what you should already know.

&lt;p>Do all the things the techs always want you to do first, such as:&lt;br>
reboot the computer, empty the recycle bin, run scandisk, run defrag, run&lt;br>
your antivirus program. Write all this stuff down.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I Absolutely adore cheap, knock-off toys, especially robots and the ilk…. As is evidenced by my collection of robots, which number quite a few, due mostly to the ready availablility of Cool Spawn and Gundam robots, my robot addiction + Ebay, and due in part to the plentiful nature of cheap gundam etc knock-offs at places like “Big Lots” and “Dollar General” stores.&lt;br>

&lt;p>I was driving along Woodward ave. (a 4-lane road), and I was coming upon a stoplight (Which was at an intersection of another 4-lane road running perpendicular. The light was green) about 40 feet in front of me. I was preparing to continue my way happily through when I noticed, in the lane beside mine (there were no other cars about) up by the stoplight, was a pickup truck, with its brakelights on, stopped akimbo in the intersection. And a large dust cloud was escaping it, further into the intersection. Now, I’m not one to gawk, and I hate those people who stop to stare at things in the road, so I took a haphazard glance out the passenger side window as I drove past the pickup…..&lt;br>
And what I saw, making the dust, was a pull-behind trailer full of lumber racing along of its own accord, past the intersection, and into the corner Texaco, where it, in the exact 3 seconds I happened to be staring at it, collided with a big stupid SUV attempting to leave the gas station.&lt;br>
The wood went flying up and under and around the car; the most part of the stack serving to pin the drivers side door shut, while the bottommost beams slid out inder the bottom of the SUV, coming to rest on the other side of the thing (as I could see as I drove past it, affording myself a better view of the OTHER side of the SUV)&lt;br>
Like I said, I’m not the type to stop and gawk, so I kept on driving; my two passengers hadn’t even seen it, and I remarked as I drove past and realized exactly what I had just seen, a Rogue Trailer on the rampage. They turned around in time to see the results of the crash, but not the impact itself.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>/archives/1186/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jun 2000 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/1186/</guid><description>&lt;p>The only really *haunted* place I have ever seen with my own eyes is the old Forks of Cypress slave house, the one that wasn’t there anymore when I saw it. Since then I have done extended research into that place, and I found out a few interesting facts. For one thing, it is at the fork of two creeks, which fits in with Unxmaal’s idea. For another thing, the main house was built on an Indian burial mound. The tribe whose ancestors were buried there begged James Jackson to keep it as it was, to not disturb it in any way, so that although they were being herded to Oklahoma at the time, they could journey back with their children someday and let the children get in touch with the spirits of their ancestors. James Jackson totally agreed, promised to keep it pristine, and as soon as they were gone he built a mansion on top of the mound. Note that that mansion is no longer there. In fact, note also that the Jackson family no longer even owns the grounds. James Jackson also had a good bit of hard luck in his life, after he did that.&lt;br>
I’ve never really seen anything else that strange in my life. I’ve gone ghost hunting quite a lot in the past few years, but I’ve never found anything like what I stumbled on by accident there. Soon after I started driving, I began going by the Forks of Cypress plantation, just for the hell of it. I noticed this old slave house right by the road. I can still remember it, right down to the pattern of the walls. That fall my history class took a field trip to the plantation, and to my complete surprise, the house was gone.&lt;br>
“What happened?” I asked a friend. “It was here a month ago! Surely I would have heard about it if something had happened to it, right?”&lt;br>
This earned me a curious look. “What are you talking about? That slave cabin burned down four years ago.”&lt;br>
Oh.&lt;br>
I freaked out. Nothing like that had ever happened to me before. Ever. Nothing like that has happened since. It’s the one paranormal happening that I have ever come across. I developed a theory that those who didn’t know the house was gone could still see it, and scared the bejesus out of ShadowStitch and Paul testing the theory out.&lt;br>
I can see ley lines and mana playing a part in this, but I can also see pissed off dead people having a lot to do with it as well…&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>/archives/1188/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jun 2000 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/1188/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://belps.freewebsites.com/index2.htm">This&lt;/a> guy got spammed, and then got even.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>/archives/1192/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jun 2000 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/1192/</guid><description>&lt;p>Okay, everybody vote for &lt;a href="http://www.harrybrowne.org">this guy&lt;/a>.
