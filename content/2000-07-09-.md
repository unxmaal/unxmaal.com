my Corn Pops cereal alerted me to the website, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.eetandern.com">eetandern.com.</a>

Here, I can save and spend a certain number of points, determined by secret codes printed inside boxes of cereal.  
let&#8217;s see&#8230;. I earned 35 points for this box of cereal&#8230;.  
And a Game Boy costs 6400 points&#8230;then&#8230;&#8230;  
If I don&#8217;t get any more than 35 points per box&#8230;.  
I need to eat roughly 182 more boxes of cereal.  
Which, at current average supermarket prices, totals over 730$.
