Pee-wee football time yet again on Sand Mountain. Somebody lock me in a closet, _PLEASE_. I do not wish to be responsible for orphaning all of those children in the midst of one of my fits. It just really would not matter much at all (from a legal standpoint) that I would be freeing same children from a life of servitude to parents that choose to live vicariously through little Jon and Jen&#8230;.
