To [Nyx][1], regarding a [West Wing recap][2] she was trying to get me to read at 4 AM: 

&#8220;For me, attempting to read a West Wing recap is like trying to eat sushi at an authentic sushi bar. There&#8217;s a ton of pretext and hidden innuendo, and a whole language behind everything, but I just wanted a California roll and I can&#8217;t figure out how to get the chef&#8217;s attention. Oh, and they keep putting lemon wedges in my water.&#8221;
