I&#8217;ve been really excited by virtualization lately, so of course I&#8217;ve been drooling over the potential of the [MacBook Pro][1]. 

I considered the Macbook, but decided I enjoyed the large screen and fast graphics of the Powerbook too much to give them up. 

On Monday I sold my G4 Powerbook to a friend of mine, and ran to the Apple store to buy the MacBook Pro. I spent a full ten minutes explaining how I was buying one &#8220;today&#8221; to the spiky-haired Mac sales guy, who promptly walked off. I found another salesperson, named Sulgi Kim, who was very nice and gave me a discount on my .Mac subscription along with my new notebook.

So far, the Macbook Pro is hands-down faster than my Powerbook. It&#8217;s hard to quantify, but in user-experience terms, things that used to take a moment now take no time at all. For example, Adium always took a second or two to load. Now it&#8217;s virtually instant. 

The migration from Powerbook to MacBook was relatively painless: when prompted, I connected a firewire cable between the two laptops, and waited for about an hour. When I logged into the MacBook Pro, everything was there, just as I&#8217;d left it on my Powerbook. 

Well, sort of. 

Little Snitch, a nice little &#8220;outbound firewall&#8221;, kernel panicked on login, so I had to remove it. Apple&#8217;s X11 doesn&#8217;t seem to work at all, and was in fact missing until I installed it. I&#8217;m still working on it.

Regarding virtualization: I haven&#8217;t yet installed Bootcamp, but I will soon. Meanwhile, I&#8217;ve been working with both Ubuntu Linux and WinXP under [Parallels][2], which truly rocks. WinXP is very fast under Parallels, much more so than it ever was under Virtual PC. And for $40, Parallels is a steal.
