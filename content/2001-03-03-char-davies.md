As I look at Char Davies&#8217; <A HREF="http://www.immersence.com/">Immersence</A> work for 010101, I can&#8217;t help but wonder when we&#8217;ll start seeing &#8220;biological hallucination&#8221;-themed wallpapers at [Skinz.org][1]. My estimate is about two weeks for this to trickle down into the Skinnerz&#8217; consciousnesses.
