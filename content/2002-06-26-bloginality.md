W00t! My [Bloginality][1] is [INTJ][2]!

&#8220;_As an INTJ, you are Introverted, iNtuitive, Thinking, Judging.</p> 

This makes your primary focus on Introverted Thinking with an Extraverted Intution.

This is defined as a NT personality, which is part of Carl Jung&#8217;s Rational (Knowledge Seeking) type, and more specifically the Mastermind or Scientist.

You aren&#8217;t as openly affectionate as some of you NT counterparts, and this may cause other bloggers to assume you aren&#8217;t as friendly. Your ideas and actual applications for these ideas are brilliant, however, and you might be more likely to create something masterful on your journal.</i>&#8220;

Yes, masterful, such as my subtly rebellious comments-posting popup windows, or my iconoclastic dada-esque System links.
