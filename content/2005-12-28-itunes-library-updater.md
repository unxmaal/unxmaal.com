[ITLU][1] allows you to scan a Windows system for mp3s and add them to your iTunes library, regardless of the source. Most importantly, it allows you to _update_ your existing library, which iTunes doesn&#8217;t allow. You&#8217;ll need this app and a pile of mp3s, whether they&#8217;re on your computer&#8217;s hard drive or on an external drive [even on an external system]. You can have ITLU scan your whole system for mp3s and add them to iTunes, or point it at a specific place.
