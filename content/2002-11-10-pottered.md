Because [Laura][1] is the best girlfriend ever [and also because she had free press passes], she took me to see a sneak preview of a highly-anticipated yet-to-be-released [movie][2]! 

Quick review: I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s better than the first movie, because it&#8217;s much darker, and the monster scenes should cause some irreparable psychological trauma to unsuspecting children everywhere.
