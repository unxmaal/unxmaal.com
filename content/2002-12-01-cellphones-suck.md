&#8220;I mean, face it &#8211; cellphone companies are selling GI Joe walkie-talkies with a ludicrous backend retransmission system. They all can&#8217;t help but suck. They had peppered the face of the planet with poles before some wise guy said &#8220;Hey, we could BURY this ugly shit&#8221;. 

&#8220;Then radio was invented. Now they are taking the TV off the air and putting it on wires and the phones are coming off the wires and going on the air. 

&#8220;But first the cellphone companies have to pepper the face of the planet with transmission towers.

&#8220;Anyway, SBC Amerisuck finally pissed me off enough that as soon as my cellphone gets here, I&#8217;m calling them. &#8220;Yank the copper, assholes. I don&#8217;t need ya no more.&#8221; &#8220;
