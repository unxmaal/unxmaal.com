[Mairix][1] is super-fast mail-indexing app that might convince me to use [Mutt][2] instead of my beloved [Pine][3]. 

Mairix adds [vFolders][4] to Mutt, which is the only reason I use the [Evolution][5] email client. [14,307 emails &#8211;and counting &#8212; means for a messy inbox.]

If Mutt had a learning curve that was anything less than 90&#176;, I&#8217;d be using it now.
