Due to a bad dining decision, I went to lunch at Burger King last week. As I moved through the line, I noticed a slightly overweight Hispanic girl leaning against the counter, waiting for her food. She was wearing low-cut hip-hugger jeans.

Here&#8217;s my Fashion Hint for the month:

If you are a girl, and you have a .. hair problem.. don&#8217;t wear low-cut jeans. Most importantly, if you are a girl and you have thick glossy ass-hair, ass-hair that has crawled out of your ass and up your spine to reach your mid-back in some unholy ass-hair creeper-vine fashion, ass-hair that would be more fitting on a swarthy Italian sailor&#8217;s chest [or head], please, _please_, for the love of all that is holy, **please do not wear low-cut jeans when you have an ass-pelt!** 

If you are part wolf, or have a hormonal disorder, or are really a swarthy Italian sailor who cross-dresses, please wear normal jeans and maybe a parka or two. Keep your ass-pelt contained. Do it for the children.
