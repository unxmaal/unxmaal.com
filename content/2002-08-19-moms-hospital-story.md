My mother works in histology at a city hospital. She enjoys telling me terrible and gruesome tales of the things that happen at her work:

&#8220;We had a poor old girl die from an intercranial bleed-on at 9:15 wednesday night. She was an organ donor so they took her to surgery immediately afterward and took out her organs and her bones. 

&#8220;At 3:00 PM on Thursday, Administration called me to see where the body was. We didn&#8217;t know there was a body in the morgue. I went back to the morgue and there she was: lying _out_ in the room, no fridge, just _flat_ (no bones), wrapped in paper, like a roast. 

&#8220;I called her family, and her brother said the &#8220;county&#8221; was on the way to pick up the body so the morgue workers left the body out so the county workers could sign and get it. 

&#8220;At 1:00 PM on Saturday, Administration called me. The woman&#8217;s brother had just called to tell Administration that the funeral home would be out later to get the body. 

&#8220;I went back to the morgue, and sure enough, there in the same place, _not refrigerated_, is this flattened, two-day-old dead woman still laying there on the slab. 

&#8220;By now she had rigor mortis, but of course she had no bones so she couldn&#8217;t poke up too much. 

&#8220;Stuff was seeping out of her eyes because the eye bank had taken her corneas, and stuff was oozing out of her mouth, filling up the paper around her head.

&#8220;It was gruesome, but it&#8217;s also sad. Just think: this woman had donated her organs and tissue, doing the one last good thing she could do on earth, but once Surgery harvested them, they shoved her body aside. 

&#8220;It&#8217;s really disrespectful.

&#8220;I called Administration, and they made Surgery get back in there and put the woman&#8217;s body in the fridge until the funeral home arrived.&#8221;
