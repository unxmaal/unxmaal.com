While looking for photographic evidence to back up my abject fear of the [Teeth of Kirsten Dunst][1], I&#8217;ve discovered a hobby far more pathetic than &#8230; well &#8230; blogging: taking photos of yourself with (or near) [celebrities][2]. 

If that&#8217;s not bad enough for you, how about getting your own [custom-made][3] PC games?
