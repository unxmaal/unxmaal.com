YYYYYYEEEEESSSSSS!!!!!!!  


  
Ooooohhhhh how I&#8217;ve waited for this day. Now all I need is a DVD player!

  
Now that I&#8217;ve quit rambling, [Digital Leisure][1] has released [Dragon&#8217;s Lair][2] On DVD. I ooo&#8217;d and aaah&#8217;d and drooled over this game back in the day when it was on the arcade. There have been several ports that used the same name for the NES, SNES, Sega and such but none could capture the same quality and gameplay. Go [buy][3] this today and get to wastin some quality time in front of the tube!
