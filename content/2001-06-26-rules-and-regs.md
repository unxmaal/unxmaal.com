I&#8217;ve had a few requests for clarification of the little numbers beside the sidebar links, and the differences between the sidebar boxes. 

The numbers reflect the number of times someone has clicked through to a linked page. At the end of the month, I sort links based on that number, highest to lowest. This is error prone and assumes a number of things: that I&#8217;m the only person who reads my page, thus moving the links I read most closer to the top, and that people are honest. If you want, you can smack that link a hundred times, and load up the numbers. Since I&#8217;m a mean bastard, I can also just edit the file back down to zero. It&#8217;s not that big of a deal. ðŸ™‚

[I say this because I KNOW that [Daniel][1] spends the 30th of the month running a script that constantly hits his link. I just KNOW it. But that&#8217;s ok, cos I left spiders in his bathroom.]

The different subsections are pure egoboost. Rules are as follows:

<center>
  <b>Minions</center></b></p> 
  
  <p>
    In order to join the esteemed ranks of Minion of Unxmaal, you must:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Send me email swearing Eternal MinionitudeTM
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you have your own webpage, please add a link to Unxmaal.com. I must specify that this link be on your main page, not on a separate &#8220;Links&#8221; page or dropdown box. If you&#8217;d like, use one of the banners located here.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Again, if you have your own webpage, please add a link to no less than two other Minions. I must specify that this link be on your main page, not on a separate &#8220;Links&#8221; page or dropdown box. I&#8217;m sure they will return the favor.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <center>
      <b>Adoration</center></b></p> 
      
      <p>
        Pages in this category are pages that A. I like, and B. have linked back to me. Yup, total ego slut. These are people that I&#8217;d really like to be Minions, but have never asked.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <center>
          <b>Linkfodder</center></b></p> 
          
          <p>
            Pages in this category are pages that A. I like, and B. have never linked back to me (for which they shall perish in flames!). It is true that some people have page designs that don&#8217;t support links on the main page. My page design doesn&#8217;t support linking to people who don&#8217;t reciprocate. Also, links in Linkfodder will eventually go away, being replaced with other interesting sites, all in a vain hope of finding more
          </p>
          
          <p>
            people who&#8217;ll assuage my petty ego and link my stupid little page.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Hope this answers your questions!
          </p>
