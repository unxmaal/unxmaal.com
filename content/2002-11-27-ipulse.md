After about a week, I&#8217;ve uninstalled [iPulse][1]. I don&#8217;t see the point in using a CPU load monitor that uses 30% of the CPU load to report that it&#8217;s using 30% of the CPU load. 

And Ye Gods! What **nagware**! For a $10 program, iPulse comes with a suite of &#8220;buy-me&#8221; irritations that rival security measures used by large office suites, including &#8220;register me&#8221; panels that pop up once an hour, hopping Dock icons, and the worst: a spoken &#8220;register me&#8221; alert. I&#8217;d used the program for less than four days when, in the middle of the night, I heard a loud, booming voice, coming from my G4, demanding that I &#8220;REGISTER IPULSE!!&#8221;. After checking System Preferences several times to ensure I had &#8220;Spoken Alerts&#8221; turned off, I eventually decided that the application itself was simply being obnoxious. 

LoadInDock and NetstatInDock may be older, uglier, and kludgier, but they&#8217;re free, and they are far less irritating.
