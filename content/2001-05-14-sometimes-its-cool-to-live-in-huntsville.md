Sometimes it strikes me that Huntsville is a little unlike any other southern city. Today, on our return trip from visiting my family for Mother&#8217;s Day, Megan and I saw a car for sale. Its amazingly low miles and reasonable asking price made this &#8217;96 model tantalizingly within reach. The moment demanded action: I dialed the telephone number, recognizable as a powertel prefix, as we drove away.

The woman that answered was pleasant, even eager to describe the car. We agreed to meet later in the afternoon so Megan and I could check it out from behind the wheel. As we closed the conversation, I realized I hadn&#8217;t introduced myself&#8230;

&#8220;I&#8217;ll see you at six, then. My name is Rod.&#8221;

&#8220;See you there at six&#8230; and my name is <A HREF="http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/davis.html">Jan Davis</A>.&#8221;

Everything clicked &#8212; the front bumper still had a Texas plate (from Houston), the rear tag had an Auburn frame, and the ubiquitous red NASA rectangle stuck in the bottom left of the windshield. 

Following some financial wizardry, a visit to the credit union for earnest money, and a rendezvous to return my sister to Dad, Megan and I met Jan a minute or two after six and drove the car (it&#8217;s everything we thought). Since she was singly stranded with two cars, I helped ferry both the beautiful roadster and her sleek new SUV back to her home.

Now how often do you run into someone that has spent nearly a MONTH in orbit? Frankly, I don&#8217;t know exactly what my subliminal preconception of an astronaut (albeit former) on an off day might have been, but she didn&#8217;t fit it. My preconception must&#8217;ve been something more or less than normal, because I was surprised and put at ease by her comfortable, easygoing conversation. And jeez, she&#8217;s like, the deputy director of the flight projects directorate at Marshall Space Flight Center or something. =]

Maybe the Mechanical Engineer in her shone through when describing the automaker&#8217;s craftmanship, but her time as an astronaut isn&#8217;t a badge or medal she wears overtly. She&#8217;s cool. And she unknowingly helped me correct a notion or two I didn&#8217;t even realize I had. Now if we can just buy her car&#8230;

<FONT SIZE="1">No, I didn&#8217;t mention what sort of car. On purpose. If it works out I&#8217;ll let you know.</FONT>
