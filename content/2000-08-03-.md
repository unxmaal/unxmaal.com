I&#8217;ve been informed that some of you heathens don&#8217;t know who [Curve][1] is. You should all be ashamed of yourselves. 

The first thing I suggest you do is go to [UBL][2] and purchase &#8220;[Doppelganger][3],&#8221; &#8220;[Cuckoo][4]&#8220;, and &#8220;[Come Clean][5]&#8220;. Once you&#8217;ve paid your dues, put &#8220;Doppelganger&#8221; into the largest stereo system you can find &#8212; I suggest going to Best Buy or Palm Audio/Visual (in Huntsville). Turn the volume all the way up, and press &#8220;Play&#8221;. 

This screeching, howling, multilayered wall of guitar noise, beautiful, ethereal vocals, and searing electric sequencing is the work of guitarist Dean Garcia and singer Toni Halliday. Perhaps you&#8217;ll notice a similarity between Curve and pop-group Garbage &#8212; there is a reason for this. You see, Garbage is the pop-commercial clone of Curve, cleaned up for public consumption. 

For the uninitiated, Curve does sound a lot like Garbage. I&#8217;ve fooled people with Doppleganger, telling them it was a &#8220;new Garbage&#8221; CD. However, it only takes a few tracks to realize that Curve is better-produced, more coherent musically, and far more gripping.
