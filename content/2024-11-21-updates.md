I've realized I haven't posted much here because, after some introspection, I've realized that I really hate interacting with Wordpress.

So Wordpress is gone, and I've migrated the site to a git repo. 

The workflow is super simple:

- make a change to some text files
- git add, commit, push
- a Github Action runs Hugo to build the site

Plus this means my hosting bill is now $200/year cheaper.
