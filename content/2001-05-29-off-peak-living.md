I really like the idea of &#8221;[Off-Peak Living][1]&#8220;. I keep trying to get up before 9 AM, and to not stay up until 5 AM, but I&#8217;m slowly realizing that I _enjoy_ having this behemoth of a city all to myself. There&#8217;s no traffic problems at 3 AM. The restaurants (that are open) aren&#8217;t crowded. I do a lot of work (or play) in the wee hours that I&#8217;d otherwise never get done in normal daytime hours. If I need to run errands, I can go after noon, when nobody&#8217;s around.
