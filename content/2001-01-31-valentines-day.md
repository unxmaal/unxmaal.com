I&#8217;m completely with [Sydney][1] on this one: <A HREF="http://sydneydawn.blogspot.com/?/2001_01_01_sydneydawn_archive.html#2177021">boycott</A> Valentine&#8217;s Day. 

Well, I&#8217;ll probably burn some games for my little brother, but I don&#8217;t forsee myself doing anything remotely interesting on V-Day. I&#8217;m not bitter; I&#8217;ve just not met anyone new in a while. Part of this I can confidantly blame on my work schedule, and the rest I can honestly blame on my own hermitlike laziness. I&#8217;ll just sit around and goof off and if something nice happens to fall into my lap, great! Hey, it [worked][2] for [Kevin][3].
