Take a look at the lower right, and you&#8217;ll see the Books box. Since I read constantly, going through an average of one book a week, I decided to list the books I&#8217;ve read in a file. Problem was, the [file][1] was far too long, and is destined only to get longer. [Rick][2] used his mad php-ninja skilz to make a little 5-line script that pulls only the first ten books. I fear his leetness.
