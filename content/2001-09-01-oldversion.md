<A HREF="http://www.oldversion.com/">OldVersion.com</a>: &#8220;Because newer is not always better.&#8221;

This site stores older versions of commonly-used programs. Once you download and install the bloated ad-flashing horror that is the newest 2000b version of [ICQ][1], you will understand why it&#8217;s nice to have a copy of ICQ [98a][2].
