Today, I experienced the Interview from Hell. 

I applied for a job via [AJC][1] yesterday, and an hour later an HR rep for the company called me. She said the interview would take 30 minutes, and to be there at 9 AM.

When I got there at about 8:45, they herded me and 60 other people into a very small room, and gave us an application to fill out, and a huge test.

The test was initially no big deal: written communication (write out an email about something) and windows trivia (what is a 32-bit operating system?). 

However, the majority of the test was the logic questions. Each question had a row of numbered boxes, and in the boxes were numbers, and you had to follow a flowchart that had instructions like &#8216;add the number in the first box with the number of the box that has the number of the first box in it&#8217;, and then &#8216;change instruction 2 to increment one number in the first numbered box mentioned&#8217;, and so on. There were fifteen _pages_ of questions like that, and each question got harder, and progressively more complex. 

Three hours later, everyone was still crammed into the room, working, and I decided I no longer wanted to work for this company.

I stopped answering the logic questions after about the 10th question. 

Three and a half hours after I arrived, they finally called me in for the interview, and things went well &#8230; until the the tech support manager noticed that I didn&#8217;t complete his exam.

He asked me why I didn&#8217;t finish it. &#8220;I felt that the questions weren&#8217;t an adequate use of my time.&#8221; 

He actually got _angry_, and said, in a hateful tone, &#8220;So you didn&#8217;t think the position was important enough to finish the questions?&#8221;

At that point, I probably still could have saved face, and even gotten the job, if I&#8217;d come up with a slick answer. However, I realized that this jerk who was yelling at me would be my boss. 

&#8220;Actually, by the tenth question, I realized that this is not the kind of company I would enjoy working for. I&#8217;m sorry I wasted my time and yours. Thanks, though.&#8221; And I walked out.

I count this as another Life Lesson: &#8220;If you loathe the company before you get a chance to interview, just leave&#8221;. I&#8217;m sad that it took me a whole morning to learn that.
