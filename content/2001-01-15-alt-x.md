&#8220;Since [Alt-X][1]&#8216;s inception in 1993, our primary mission has been to challenge both the art and literary publishing establishments by supporting some of the most iconoclastic voices and visions in the international art world. &#8220;

I highly recommend [Black Ice Fiction][2] and [Alt-X Audio][3].
