Look at the label on the last package you received from UPS, or at the back of your driver&#8217;s license. Chances are there&#8217;s a rectangular area on there containing tiny rectangles, circles, hexagons, or similar patterns. You&#8217;re looking at a two-dimensional barcode, which can store several kilobytes of data as compared to the roughly twelve bytes in the UPC barcode on that bottle of lotion you keep by the bed. <a href="http://networkgeek.org/" target="networkgeek">Daniel</a> sent me a story at the New York Times about a club in Boston that is pulling and storing the name, age, height, home address, and other specifics of its patrons. So I want to know just what is on the back of my own license. <a href="http://www.tech.purdue.edu/graduate/courses/Tech621aw/2Dbarcodes.PDF" target="2dbarcode">Here</a> is a document that gives a brief introduction to the roughly twenty different types of 2D barcodes in common use today. Read more for further stuff as I find it.

The barcodes in use on Georgia driver&#8217;s licenses appear to be encoded in the PDF417 symbology, which was invented by some Wang guy at Symbol Technologies and is now in the public domain. Symbol has a marketing-heavy <a href="symbol.com href="http://www.symbol.com/products/barcode_scanners/2d<U>products</U>pdf417_technolog.html&#8221;>document</a> on PDF417.
