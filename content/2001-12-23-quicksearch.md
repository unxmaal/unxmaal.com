On [Rick][1]&#8216;s recommendation, I installed [Dave&#8217;s Quicksearch][2] toolbar. I&#8217;m not entirely convinced of its utility, though I&#8217;ve not used it much yet. 

I&#8217;m still quite happy with [Opera][3]&#8216;s handling of search queries: in the address bar, type &#8220;g term1 term2&#8221; to search [Google][4] for the listed terms.
