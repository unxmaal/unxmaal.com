To further my World of Warcraft fandom:

The [Kill on Sight][1] mod gives particularly hated enemies a red &#8220;dragon&#8221; identifier above their name icon, so as to help you remember them if you happen to run across them again. 

This is pretty handy for me, although none of my characters are really to the point of being able to handle any type of PvP encounter.
