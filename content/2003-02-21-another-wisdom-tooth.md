Another wisdom tooth is gone from my head. I&#8217;m very disturbed to be losing chunks of my skull, but it had to go, as it had grown in slightly crooked and was stressing my other teeth. The whole procedure took about ten minutes, and afterwards I felt a lot better than I did a few weeks back, when the tooth started bothering me. 

If you&#8217;re in the Atlanta area and are looking for a good dentist, [Dr. Ken Berger][1] is very good.
