I&#8217;ve been playing Final Fantasy Tactics, which is my favorite of all the Final Fantasy games, and I think is one of the best RPG/Tactics game ever. Here&#8217;s the [job FAQ][1] I&#8217;ve been using. 

I can&#8217;t find the controllers for my poor old PSX, so I&#8217;m using an excellent PSX emulator called [EPSXE][2]. 

The emulation is remarkably fast, and excepting a few odd glitches, the game is very playable. Movie music doesn&#8217;t seem to play, but the in-game MIDI tracks seem to play just fine, although they do slow down if the machine starts running too many tasks. EPSXE handles input from my old Microsoft Sidewinder gamepad very well, even though the gamepad is missing many of the buttons of the original PSX controller.

I&#8217;ve played my other favorite PSX game, Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, and it plays very nicely as well. Again, CDDA music doesn&#8217;t seem to work, but after a while the music gets repetitive anyway.
