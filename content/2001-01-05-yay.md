Well kids, evidently [Blogger][1] hates me, because I haven&#8217;t been able to update for about two days. 

That&#8217;s ok, because I&#8217;ve been meaning to try out [Grey Matter][2]. 

[Noah Grey][3] is my tiny god. This is the first post using the new system, and I&#8217;m so impressed I&#8217;m giddy. I&#8217;ve got comment-posting, karma, archiving, and all sorts of other goodies, and I don&#8217;t have to read some A-lister&#8217;s whining every time I log in to post.
