Some astronomers have [purchased][1] an abandoned NSA base in Virginia. The [NSA][2] essentially just left everything behind, so there&#8217;s miles of premium fiber optic cabling, RFI-shielded light bulbs, satellite dishes, tunnels, and static-proof welded carpeting &#8212;everything a growing boy could need! 

I want photos, and [Daniel][3] wants a model of the place in an [Unreal Tournament][4] map. 

Ooh.. I found [photos][5]! Click the &#8220;Tours&#8221; link.
