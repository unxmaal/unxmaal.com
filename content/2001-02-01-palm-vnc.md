[VisorCentral][1] has a nice article on <A HREF="http://www.visorcentral.com/page/0-6-81-1-6.htm">PalmVNC</A>. That&#8217;s right kids, add this to the list of unholy things you can do with your PalmOS handheld: controlling your desktop PC. Granted, this sounds a lot silly if you don&#8217;t have a wireless Palm, but it can act as a quick fix if you need to work on monitorless servers, or your screen locks up due to an [ornery video card][2].
