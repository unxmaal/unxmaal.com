Weird things are afoot on the mighty Unxmaal server. Every few days Perl apps [including Greymatter] appear to crash with a segmentation fault. The next day, these scripts work fine. In a fit of desperation, I attempted to install Moveabletype, only to have the base installer script segfault when it ran for the first time. Any ideas would be much appreciated.
