Some people didn&#8217;t believe me when I said that BSD is far cooler than Linux. Now I have [proof][1]. 

> &#8220;_If you are not a BSD or Linux user, then this one will be easy. Just take our word for it that the truely el33t use BSD and not Linux. If you&#8217;re a Linux user, you have to access that place deep deep down. You know where I&#8217;m talking about, that one little place in your heart that you don&#8217;t talk about at parties. The place where those doubts about yourself creep in, where you feel (secretly) that FreeBSD and OpenBSD are too intimidating, so you use Linux. You have to access that part and feel deep down inside that BSD is in fact technically superior to Linux. Even just a little bit. And you don&#8217;t have to tell anyone._&#8220;
