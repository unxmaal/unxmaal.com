Yay! I&#8217;m off to Atlanta for the next two days, where I&#8217;ll be staying with my pal <a target="_blank" href="http://www.starhammer.com">Whois</a> (I forget his real name). Jeff and I are going to the Nine Inch Nails concert Saturday night, so if you&#8217;re one of the three people who actually read this site, maybe we&#8217;ll see you there. =]
