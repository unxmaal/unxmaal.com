One of my favorite [read: &#8220;only&#8221;] childhood Nintendo games was [Capcom][1]&#8216;s &#8220;[Section Z][2]&#8220;. Section Z was like the poor-man&#8217;s version of [Metroid][3]: guy in a space-suit killing things in order to kill a bigger &#8216;Brain&#8217; thing.

The one important thing about this game was that it taught me how to non-linearly map things. I was used to pen-and-paper RPGs, so I was used to drawing areas that had rooms that lined up. After a few days of frustration trying to map Section Z, I realized that it didn&#8217;t matter where I put the rooms on my map. At the end of each room there were two teleporters. The key to mapping [and beating] the game was to note where the teleporters took your character. By the time I was done with the game, I had dispensed with graph paper, and just had a list of section names and where their &#8216;up&#8217; or &#8216;down&#8217; teleporters took me.
