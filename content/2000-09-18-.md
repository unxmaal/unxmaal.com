<blink>Yay for me!  
</blink>  
After months of harrowing poverty, I find myself gainfully employed _once again_ with the fine folks at Babbage&#8217;s/Software Etc.  
My new co-workers seem like real great guys, being game freaks themselves, and having recently acquired the store&#8217;s command from ..less than reputable former management.  
In any case, I&#8217;m stupidly gleeful tonight, with the heady prospect of a part-time job to occupy my free hours, and hopefully pad my anorexic wallet. ðŸ™‚  
<font color="white">As for exactly HOW padded, only my hours, my wages, and my employee discount will tell.<br /></font>

  Also, congrats on your upcoming wedding, Robbie, if you&#8217;re reading this.</font>
