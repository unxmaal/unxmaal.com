Marking Martian [craters][1] has never been so easy, or so much fun! 

This is an experiment in distributed computing, where volunteers can log on and classify Martian craters, work that is easy but very time-consuming. According to the site, &#8220;_Since inception on November 17, 2000, all clickworkers combined have contributed 15947 crater-marking and 4398 crater-classification entries._&#8221; It&#8217;s much more entertaining than playing Solitaire.
