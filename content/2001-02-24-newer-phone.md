Friday, on my way to Atlanta, I returned my Sprint PCS phone. I really liked the _phone_; the service, however, left much to be desired. Apparently US Unwired, the affiliate who serves as Sprint PCS in my area, has a signal area that extends for a whopping thirty square feet in the city of Huntsville. This includes the mall kiosk where I bought the phone, and possibly the parking lot, too.

I succumbed to peer pressure, again, and got a [Powertel][1] phone. It&#8217;s a yummy cobalt blue [Nokia 3390][2], and yes, I spent all Thursday night searching for ringtones and playing with its hidden menus. 

One day soon I shall have the Super Mario Brothers theme as my ringtone, and on that day, yes, my friends, my life will be complete.
