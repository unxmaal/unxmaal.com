[Battlefield 1942][1] is yet another example of why I hate buying video games. 

My PC isn&#8217;t high-end, but an AMD 2600+ with 1GB RAM isn&#8217;t too shabby for most games. 

Unfortunately, processor speed doesn&#8217;t mean so much for a game like BF1942.

Here&#8217;s how an average game goes:

&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll play BF1942.&#8221;

Time passes.

&#8220;Oh look, Here&#8217;s the game startup screen!&#8221; 

Time passes.

&#8220;The unescapable intro movies are over. Now I get to choose a map!&#8221; 

Time passes.

&#8220;The map is loading!&#8221; 

Time passes.

&#8220;I&#8217;m joining the game!&#8221; 

Time passes.

&#8220;Wow, I&#8217;m finally playing the game!&#8221; 

BLAM! Sniper round in the head. 

Time passes.

&#8220;Ok, I&#8217;ve respawned, and I&#8217;ve got my weapon of choice and I&#8217;m ready to &#8230;&#8221;

The game disappears. Crashes. Gone. Not even an error message.

&#8220;Screw this. I&#8217;m gonna go read a book.&#8221;
