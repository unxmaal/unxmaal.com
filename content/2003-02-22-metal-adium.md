Check out the new &#8220;unofficial&#8221; beta release of [Adium][1], complete with a [Brushed Metal][2] theme. 

After tabbed message windows, the next best thing about Adium is that it supports overriding background colors and fonts. Since I prefer a nasty green-on-black terminal-style message window, people using official AIM clients tend to squeal in pain when I message them.
