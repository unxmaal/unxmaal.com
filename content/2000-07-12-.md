Yippee! It looks like Bel Canto&#8217;s _Images_ album will be [released][1] in the US. If you haven&#8217;t heard of Bel Canto, you&#8217;re missing out on one of the most hauntingly beautiful Progressive/Post-Modern singers in the world. I highly recommend two older albums, _Birds of Passage_ and _Shimmering, Warm, & Bright_, as this band&#8217;s defining work. Look [here][2] for a sample from Anneli Drecker&#8217;s latest solo album.
