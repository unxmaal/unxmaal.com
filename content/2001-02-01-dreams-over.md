It&#8217;s sad, completely forseeable, but true: the [Dreamcast][1] is <A HREF="http://dreamcast.ign.com/news/30854.html">dead</A>.

For all this doom and gloom, though, I doubt that the Dreamcast is just going to go away. There is a growing enthusiast development scene, and Sega has apparently decided to license the hardware to third-party vendors. I, for one, would love to see a PC video card with Dreamcast graphics capabilities.
