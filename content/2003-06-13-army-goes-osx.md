According to this [Netcraft][1] article, the Army has moved their [www.army.mil][2] server to [Mac OSX][3], the first OS transition for that server since 1999. 

The article also points out that Apple has switched its Knowledge Base servers to [Solaris][4]. Other anecdotal evidence shows that Apple is performing load-balancing between Solaris and OSX servers, possible for internal investigation.
