Rachel got me a new iPhone 3G for my birthday, so I unlocked my old* iPhone using [WinPWN][1] and gave it to her. WinPWN also installed Cydia, which is basically Debian apt for the iPhone. So now I have a crippled, locked down iPhone, and Rachel has one with a complete Unix toolkit, reworked BSD subsystem, and access to a huge library of free open-source games and utilities. But hey, mine&#8217;s still faster. ðŸ˜›

* My old iPhone wasn&#8217;t that old. I took it to the Apple store two weeks ago and complained about some bubble defects in the screen. They gave me a new one on the spot. Yay!
