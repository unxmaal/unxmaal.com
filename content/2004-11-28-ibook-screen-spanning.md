One nice feature that the Powerbook has over the iBook is support for screen spanning: you can connect an external monitor to the laptop and &#8216;extend&#8217; the desktop to the new monitor. For some inexplicable reason (save maybe another &#8216;selling point&#8217; of the Powerbook), iBooks don&#8217;t ship with this feature. Instead, they only support screen &#8216;mirroring&#8217;, which is pretty worthless since the laptop goes to sleep with the lid closed. 

[Here][1]&#8216;s a simple hack to enable screen spanning on most recent iBooks. Just run the installer script, and it works. I&#8217;ve had no problems, but of course some people have complained that the hack broke their iBook, killed their dog, and ran away with their mothers.
