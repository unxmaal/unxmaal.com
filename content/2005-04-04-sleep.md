I can&#8217;t sleep for more than an hour or two without waking in a cold sweat, and I can&#8217;t eat because all the food I try tastes like ash. The pain in my gut isn&#8217;t hunger.

I&#8217;m so tired but since I can&#8217;t sleep I stay up and pack more of her things into boxes. There are so many things and so many boxes that it&#8217;s hard for me to believe that after the boxes are gone there are these huge voids. 

I&#8217;m almost done with the packing. I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s next. I keep hoping I&#8217;ll just eventually work enough that I&#8217;ll be able to sleep. 

World of Warcraft seems so dull and pointless now. I can&#8217;t be bothered to play it. It doesn&#8217;t interest me at all. I log on, look around, and log off. I want to be near people, not machines.
