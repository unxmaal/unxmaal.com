While on vacation, desperate to suckle from the Internet&#8217;s great digital teat, I find myself reduced to using an AOL dialup. 

In case you didn&#8217;t know, dialup sucks. 

With my meager trickle of Netmilk, I have been able to read a few interesting articles. One that stands out is this week&#8217;s Apple-bashing article, as published by [Wired][1]. 

This article is pure feces. Even better, a lot of tech news sites pounced on it, brandishing it as &#8216;reel nooze&#8217;. 

I wonder if they realize that it&#8217;s a slow news week, and Wired is fabricating stories again? I mean, here&#8217;s the gist of this &#8216;news story&#8217;:

Small third-party developer spends some time learning how undocumented and unstabilized Apple APIs work, and writes an app that centers on these APIs.

Apple releases a new version of their OS that includes new versions of those APIs. Since the APIs are not documented and are not stabilized, they have changed.

Third party developer&#8217;s app breaks.

TPD cries &#8220;APPLE ROBBED ME! MY BABIES WILL STARVE! DAMN THE MAN!&#8221;

Wired journalist is pushed for a deadline. &#8220;Oh crap, I&#8217;ve snorted too much coke to think! Must fake a story!&#8221;

Wired journalist sees TPD&#8217;s rant on some message board, and writes &#8220;APPLE ROBBED HIM! HIS BABIES WILL STARVE! DAMN THE MAN!&#8221;

And all the moron PC trolls who&#8217;ve never touched an Apple read the headline of the Wired article [or better, the headline of the Slashdot post about the Wired article], and they rant, &#8220;APPEL SUKCS!111 APELS ARE FRO LUSARS!!11 APLE ROBED TAHT MAN!!! HIS BABEIES WILL STARVE!! DAMN TEH MAN!!!!11&#8221;
