So, not only can [Wired][1] not ship my subscribed-for magazines, they can&#8217;t maintain editorial integrity either! 

After all the attention yesterday regarding [Danit Lidor&#8217;s shoddy journalism][2], it seems the wording of the original article has changed: 

<tt>"At Word's ISP, API Digital, Rod Montgomery, chief geek, professed no knowledge about the company's campaign."</tt> 

Hey kids! Welcome to the Internet, where everything you read can be changed, and where everything you write can be held against you.
