[Blizzard][1] has been granted [preliminary injunction][2] against [New Line Cinema][3] prohibiting them from using the term &#8216;Diablo&#8217; in any form. New Line had been planning a drug-war movie titled &#8216;Diablo&#8217;, and had changed the title to &#8220;El Diablo&#8221; last month. 

According to Blizzard&#8217;s press release, the company owns &#8220;a pending U.S. intent-to-use trademark application for &#8220;Diablo&#8221; in connection with the production and distribution of motion pictures,&#8221; which makes me wonder if we should expect a Diablo movie any time soon.

Personally, I&#8217;m all for having the [Lamborghini][4] Corporation rename their [car][5] to &#8220;MonkeySchooner&#8221;, but that&#8217;s just me.
