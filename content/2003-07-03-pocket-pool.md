Last week, my swimming pool had become a deep green, indistinguishable from the color of the murky waters of the Chattahoochee, so I decided to invest in some more pool chemicals. I went to the pool supply store, blew $120 on chemicals, and when I got home, I found that my ancient pool pump had finally died.

[Daniel][1] and I worked for most of the weekend on the pump, first removing it, then replacing it with a new, much more expensive, pump. The lady at the pool supply store was shocked and awed by the old pump, as it was so outdated that she could find no reference in her supply manual. 

By late Saturday, we had the new pump installed, but it tripped the breaker when it was turned on. I scheduled a technician to come out on Tuesday, but postponed it due to torrential rainfall. When he finally showed up on Wednesday, he spent an hour or so determining that the antedeluvian [Intermatic timer][2] had finally died as well. 

After removing the timer, the tech wired up the pump directly into the breaker box. This weekend I&#8217;ll have to buy a new timer box and splice it in, because flipping breakers to turn things on and off really sucks.
