Here&#8217;s some pertinent and very-well-researched links regarding military weather and mind control.

Be sure to put on your aluminum-foil hats and pray to the aliens.

First up, we have the [Armageddon][1] site, page 2. Notice the spooky radar artifacts.

Next, why not ask those nice Alaskans what they&#8217;re doing with their [HAARP][2] experimentations.

About those harmless vapor trails made by airplanes? Read more [here][3]. 

Finally, a lengthy rant regarding [weather control][4] served by conspiracy-theorist David Icke.

Remember the magic phrase, kids: &#8220;I can neither confirm nor deny those statements.&#8221;
