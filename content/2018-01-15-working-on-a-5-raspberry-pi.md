I&#8217;ve held off from buying a Raspberry Pi Zero for a while, in favor of Teensy or Pro Micro controllers, because what can a $5 controller really do?

I&#8217;ve been pleasantly surprised with the Zero so far. $5 got me a computer that&#8217;s half the size of a credit card, with HDMI video out, two USB ports, a GPIO header, and WIFI. Frickin&#8217; WIFI!

Performance-wise, well, it&#8217;s pretty slow. But it&#8217;s fast enough for prototyping and running LEDs, which is great for my current project.
