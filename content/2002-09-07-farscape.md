This is why TV sucks: if there&#8217;s ever a good show that doesn&#8217;t quite fit the mainstream lowest-common-denominator viewer, it gets axed. Sci-Fi&#8217;s &#8216;Farscape&#8217; is quite possibly the best sci-fi television show I&#8217;ve ever watched, and apparently Sci-Fi execs have opted out of the fifth season and decided to [cancel][1] the show. 

Perhaps some well-placed calls to Sci-Fi Programming [212-413-5821] or comments [212-413-5577] would help.
