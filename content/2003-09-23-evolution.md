After a few months of dealing with the enormous suckage that is Outlook Express, I&#8217;ve discovered a reason to install Linux: the [Ximian Evolution][1] Email client. 

The key useful feature, for me, are vFolders (virtual folders), which are customized views of your email based on rulesets. You want a folder that shows you all the email from Jim? Create a vFolder rule based on his address. How about a vFolder that contains all the email from the people in Hosting? Create a vFolder rule that includes all of their addresses. Better yet, emails can exist in multiple folders at once. 

And yes, it&#8217;s a free download, and it works with Microsoft Exchange Server, if you&#8217;re unfortunate enough to have to use one.
