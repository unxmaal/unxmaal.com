Wow! Thanks to <A HREF="http://www.topsecretrecipes.com/">Top Secret Recipes</A>, I now know how to make [Girlscout Cookies][1]! Granted, I&#8217;d have to get over my aversion to eating food that came out of my pantry, and I&#8217;m not sure where I&#8217;d find the Girlscouts (or a woodchipper, for that matter), but it&#8217;s a start!
