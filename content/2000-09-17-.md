Alas, I&#8217;ve removed the Linksluts webring stuff, at least until [Neale][1] declares [Yahoo][2] to be the Great Satan of the Internet.

**UPDATE**:  
Yes! Neale replies:

Sadly, this doesn&#8217;t mean much, as I can&#8217;t find the code for the Linksluts section because YAHOO SUCKS. Logging in to get the code requires either a Yahoo username/password (which I won&#8217;t admit to having), or a lot of personal information, such as sexual orientation, total net worth, unlisted telephone number, and the name of my last girlfriend&#8217;s mother.
