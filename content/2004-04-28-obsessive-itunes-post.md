Yes! [Apple][1] just released [iTunes 4.5][2], which includes a lot of new features, the most important [to me] being the ability to make Smart Playlists that include other Smart Playlists. 

What I&#8217;ve been doing lately is creating two playlists: &#8220;Top 4GB of songs, rated 3 or higher, not played in 2 weeks, sorted by rating&#8221;, and &#8220;Danger!!&#8221;, which is 2GB of completely random stuff [and in a library of 18000 songs or more, it&#8217;s really dangerous]. 

Then, on the iPod, I&#8217;d use its &#8220;On the Go&#8221; playlist feature to add both &#8220;Top 4GB&#8230;&#8221; and &#8220;Danger&#8221; to the main &#8220;On the Go&#8221; playlist, mixing both playlists.

This setup gave me a pretty decent chance of getting suprised by something I might actually like, but had never given a proper listen.

The addition of Smart-Playlist-inclusive Smart Playlists makes this whole process a lot easier. The only thing I can ask for now from iTunes is a true SQL backend, and a scripting pane where I can enter raw SQL queries.
