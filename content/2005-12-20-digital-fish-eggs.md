For Christmas, I got Sam a hard drive for his XBox, and shipped it via Amazon. 

Mom got the package today, along with the frozen steaks I&#8217;d ordered for my stepdad. She opened the box and saw something that said &#8216;Western Digital Caviar&#8217;, so she put it in the fridge to keep it cool.
