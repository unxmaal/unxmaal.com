Time-travelling scientists must have gone to the future and read Laura&#8217;s latest [post][1], then taken the technology and created the [Turd Twister][2]. 

Come on, if you could time-travel, wouldn&#8217;t you steal technology from the future that enabled you to create devices that turned your butt into a [Play-Doh Fun Factory][3]?

I really want one of these, just for work. Imagine the expression on the cleaning lady&#8217;s face as she finds little heart-shaped turds floating in the bowl, special, just for her.
