In reference to yesterday&#8217;s post about Quicksilver:

[Drew][1]: I think I ran across that app when I was looking for a quick way to control iTunes  
**Me:** I control iTunes via a bluetooth-enabled buttplug. I use my kegel muscles to squeeze it in certain ways to indicate &#8216;stop&#8217; or &#8216;play&#8217;.  
**Drew:** Nice.  
**Me:** The problem is that I tend to shit myself when I try to change playlists.  
**Drew:** We call those Smart Shitlists.
