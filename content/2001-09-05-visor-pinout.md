The Gooseman asks: _&#8220;Do you have a pinout/circuit diagram for making a cable to go from Visor toRS232? I&#8217;m thinking of a &#8220;straight&#8221; serial cable with adaptors for RJ-45, crossover, gender-bending etc&#8230;.&#8221;_

What I&#8217;ve found so far: <A HREF="http://www.acroname.com/robotics/info/PPRK/visor.html">Acroname Inc. PPRK Visor Support</A> says that you&#8217;ll have to add a chip. 

Here&#8217;s another [page][1] with pinouts, too.
