According to [this article][1], Sony woke up one day and realized they needed an MP3 player that people would actually buy. 

The important part lies in one of the last paragraphs: 

> _Nor are MP3 recordings necessarily illegal: &#8220;There are hundreds if not thousands of legal MP3s on the \`Net,&#8221; Ron Boire, [president of Sony Electronics&#8217; Personal Mobile Products company] said._

&#8220;Hundreds if not thousands&#8221; of legal MP3s? Let me calculate, for a moment. I own about 200 CDs, and I converted them all to about 2400 _legal_ MP3s and keep them on my PC at home. I also have remote access into my home machine, so I can listen to them at work. Since my PC is technically part of the Net, according to Mr Boire I own just about ALL of the MP3s on the Internet. I feel so special.
