Sometime last week, I started working on the clickcounter script. I just _knew_ that [Daniel][1] had been loading up his stats, so I hacked around on the script. I broke it horribly.

Since I am a genius world mastermind, I gave it to [Daniel][1] to fix, because I ph33r his leet skiLLz. Using his mad ninja powers, he was able to get IP-logging enabled on the script. Of course, once I had it installed, he clicked his link about 2000 times [with another script he made], so I was forced to go into the database and &#8220;correct&#8221; his numbers.

Take a peek at the results: <A HREF="http://unxmaal.com/clickerlog.txt">The Clickerlog</A>. As you can see, the evil Quonsar from [Blort][2] has hired illegal immigrants to click his link for him. That&#8217;s ok, because his page is really cool. Go read [it][2].
