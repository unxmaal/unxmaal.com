I don&#8217;t know about the rest of you, but <A HREF="http://www.aol.com/aim/">AIM</A> has been royally fubared for the last week. Today I&#8217;m getting a &#8216;Bad Database&#8221; error. Since [AOL][1] owns the [other][2] good messaging service, I&#8217;ll be switching over to another [monopoly][3]&#8216;s service. You may reach me at Unxmaal on [MSN][4].
