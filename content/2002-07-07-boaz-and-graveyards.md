After hiding indoors for most of the Fourth of July holiday, I dragged [Laura][1] to Boaz, with a promise of Slurpees and [cemeteries][2]. 

The first stop was a mercifully brief visit with my grandparents. Please understand: my grandparents are very sweet, very old, and live across the street from their Southern Baptist church. I&#8217;m not quite sure they understood Laura&#8217;s jet-black hair or sporadically-pierced head. 

After the &#8220;Uncomfortable Silence Fun Palace&#8221;, we met up with the world-famous [Beth][3], and drove around the countryside snapping photos of old country graveyards. Even better, Beth got me stuff! Stuff includes: the Heavy Metal Candlesticks O&#8217; Doom, a little demon for my car antenna, and a framed cross-stitch. Yay!
