When I was a kid, my stepbrother Johnny and I both had Tandy Color Computers. We only used them for games, and as soon as we got [Nintendos][1], the little CoCos soon went back into their little boxes, to be covered with dust and shoes.

One of my favorite games was [Dungeons Of Daggorath][2]. More DoD stuff <a href=http://homestead.deja.com/user.frdpd/files/">here</a>.
