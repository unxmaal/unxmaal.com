As a very premeditated post-Valentine&#8217;s Day gift to myself, I got me an [iBook][1].

Glee!

The iBook is a G3 600Mhz with 256MB RAM, 20GB harddrive, Airport [802.11b] card, built-in: 10/100BASE-T Ethernet, Firewire, 2 USB ports, CDRW/DVD combo drive, and a 14.1&#8243; display. 

Software-wise, it&#8217;s running Mac OS X, and I&#8217;ve used [Fink][2] to install the latest [Open Source][3] UN*X apps on it. 

On my work-provided Windows laptop, I had been using [Cygwin][4] to provide a framework for XFree86 under Windows, so that I could simply ssh-tunnel my X11 apps from the servers to my laptop, rather than face the Nameless Crawling Horror That Is [CDE][5] on my aging Sun Ultra 5. 

Since OS X is built on top of a BSD UNIX variant, I&#8217;ve been able to duplicate the functionality of both my Sun workstation and my Windows laptop including using the [Blackbox][6] window manager, and compiling my own [x3270][7] emulator. Plus, the iBook burns CDs, plays DVDs, and looks leet too!
