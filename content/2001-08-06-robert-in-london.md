If those of you who live in or near London felt a disturbance in the Force this weekend, like millions of voices cried out in unison and then were suddenly silenced, don&#8217;t worry, it was just my roommate Robert. He&#8217;s come to visit your loverly country, to sample its history, to soak up the sights, and to get jiggy with some hot hardcore [Internet Engineering Task Force][1] action. 

Apparently our employer mixed up Robert&#8217;s lodging vouchers with those of upper management, so he&#8217;s staying at the swank <A HREF="http://www.stayinlondon.com/thmarble.htm">Thistle Marble Arch</A> in downtown London. Note that his room has air-conditioning and is larger than a closet, so if you&#8217;re in the area, feel free to leave him some hate mail, or even some [eggnog][2].
