My pool pump is powered by an ancient, rusting [Intermatic][1] mechanical 24-hour time switch. The entire [case][2] is rusted, and the On/Off switch is [conveniently located][3] right above the two screws that terminate the live electrical wiring, which makes for great fun when attempting to turn off the pool pump with wet hands.
