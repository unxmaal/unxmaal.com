I&#8217;m trying out [SmartFTP][1], and I&#8217;m quite impressed. 

For years I used [LeechFTP][2], which has ceased development and is getting rather hoary with age. Any new FTP client would have to have the following features: free (not shareware, not a demo), multithreaded downloads, queueing support, resume-on-fail support, and an interface that wasn&#8217;t designed by a blind monkey. So far, SmartFTP has beaten out the rest on all of these fronts.
