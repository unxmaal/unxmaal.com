_&#8220;People who trade stocks, trade based on what they feel will move and they can trade for profit. Nobody makes investment decisions based on reading financial filings. Whether a company is making millions or losing millions, it has no impact on the price of the stock. Whether it is analysts, brokers, advisors, Internet traders, or the companies, everybody is manipulating the market. If it wasn&#8217;t for everybody manipulating the market, there wouldn&#8217;t be a stock market at all. . . .&#8221;_ &#8212; <A HREF="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/25/magazine/25STOCK-TRADER.html?pagewanted=all">Jonathan Lebed</A>, at age 15.
