I&#8217;ve seen (and been slightly nauseated by) about four movies in the last two months. Each and every one has been preceded by a wretched abomination of a trailer featuring that noxiously cute little vermin, Hallie Kate Eisenberg. No, you don&#8217;t understand. **Every** movie I&#8217;ve wanted to see in the last two months has been proceeded by this roachlike bucktoothed little whelp, pathetically lipsynching to some unknown Western movie &#8220;star&#8221;. I hate this kid. Really. 

And that&#8217;s why God made [this site][1]: because He loves me. Even though He wants me dead.
