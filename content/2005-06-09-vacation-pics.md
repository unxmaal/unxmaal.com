I&#8217;ve posted my vacation pics [here][1]. Note there&#8217;s a &#8220;Part Two&#8221; and a &#8220;Part Three&#8221;. 

I&#8217;ve been out in the desert for about a week, camping in Big Bend national park, and in the Davis mountains. it&#8217;s been very hot &#8212; at 109F in [Study Butte][2]. 

We only saw two Western Diamondbacks, but since we didn&#8217;t have small game hunting licenses, we didn&#8217;t catch them. We justpicked them up, took their pictures, and tossed them off the roadside. 

If you&#8217;re interested in learning more about the region, here&#8217;s a blog with a few more links: [The Desert-Mountain Times][3].

I went on a 4 mile hike up in the Chisos Mountains on the weekend. It doesn&#8217;t sound like much, but it was like 4 miles of stairs, straight up. I&#8217;m also a fatass. 

Monday was Carlsbad Caverns, which were amazing. I couldn&#8217;t do the whole tour because my legs were broken from the previous day&#8217;s hike, but the part I saw was fantastic. On the way, we ate at the [Hotel Limpia][4] in Fort Davis, TX, which has some of the best food you&#8217;ll find in that area.

We spent a lot of Tuesday driving to Concan, where we rafted down the Rio Frio on inner tubes. It was awesome &#8212; the water was a cool 60????F, and the day was overcast but in the mid-90&#8217;s. 

We started back Wednesday morning at around 7AM, and drove straight home. We got back to my dad&#8217;s at 2:30AM, and I got home today after noon.
