Swarms of vicious [stomoxys][1], or stable, flies have recently [killed][2] at least six lions in Tanzania&#8217;s famed [Ngorongoro crater][3] park. 

Apparently, this is <A HREF="http://www.lionresearch.org/current/ngorongoro.html">not the first time</a> a plague of flies has decimated the lion population in the park. In 1961-62, heavy rains permitted the stable-fly population to breed constantly for over six months, and by the end of the rains the lion population had dropped to around ten.
