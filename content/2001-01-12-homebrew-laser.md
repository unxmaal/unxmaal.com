For happy Minions everywhere: [Sam&#8217;s Home-Built Laser FAQ][1]. I can tell I&#8217;m going to have **lots** of fun with this. Oh, and if any of you see [Kevin][2] before he gets home, be sure and tell him _not_ to turn on his lightswitch. At least, not before I&#8217;m at a safe distance&#8230;
