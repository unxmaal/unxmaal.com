According to [The Register][1], &#8220;_Amazon.co.uk carries out no security checks on messages posted on its site by the authors of books it sells,_&#8221; so people are signing on with bogus Hotmail accounts and posing as book authors. 

Some will point to this as yet another reason not to trust the validity of information on the Web; I refer to a quote by some dead guy: &#8220;Never trust anything you see, and only half of what you read.&#8221;
