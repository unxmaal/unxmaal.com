A few weeks ago, [Kevin][1] bought a [wooden dinosaur model][2] for 99 cents. When he got it home, he found that someone had already removed all of the little wooden bones, and donated the remains to charity. How nice.

Not one to be set back by adversity, Kevin [took the wooden templates][3], scanned them, enlarged them by about 300%, and traced them onto large pieces of foam board.

Kevin now has a [four-foot long Velociraptor model][4] in his living room.
