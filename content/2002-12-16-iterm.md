If you&#8217;re running [OS X][1], replace Terminal.app with [iTerm][2]. 

iTerm is a free, open-source terminal client whose most attractive feature, for me, is **tabbed terminal sessions**, like [Mozilla][3]&#8216;s tabbed browser windows. Each tab can be configured with its own name, transparency, and color scheme, and if the session changes [example: new mail in mutt], the session name text changes to red.
