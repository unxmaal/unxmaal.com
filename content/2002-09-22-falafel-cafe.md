If you&#8217;re in the mood for Middle-Eastern food, check out the [Falafel Cafe][1] on Cobb Parkway in Marietta. Finding the little cafe is not easy, but it&#8217;s worth it. This is by far one of the best Middle-Eastern restaurants I&#8217;ve been to in the Atlanta area [out of three]. Yesterday we had stuffed grape leaves and eggplant dip as appetizers, and the [falafel][2] platter. I ordered the appetizers because I simply refused to believe that a $4 entree made entirely of vegetables would fill me up. I was very much wrong; the falafels are delicious and the pita-style bread is very filling. 

This is definitely a restaurant I&#8217;ll frequent.
