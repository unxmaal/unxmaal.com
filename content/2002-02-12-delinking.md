I finally delinked [Wil][1]. I consider this to be akin to shooting a gimpy horse &#8211;a mercy-killing. 

I was ok with the constant poorly-researched prattling about political issues, the non-stop hawking of autographed &#8220;Star Trek&#8221; memorabilia, and even the incessant begging for technical support. However, the sheer hypocrisy of last week&#8217;s beg for Valentine&#8217;s Day cash forced my hand. Rather than read my ethical qualms about that, read [Beth][2]&#8216;s. 

It seems to me that stars are Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde monsters, and Fame and Attention are the presto-chango drugs that trigger their changeover into monstrosity. Stars that have lost their fame, and their superhuman monstrosity, deflate into normal pleasantry, because they are forced to deal with regular people on regular terms. In Wil&#8217;s unfortunate case, he was so very pleasant that people started reading what he wrote online&#8230; giving him an unexpected large-bore dose of Mr. Hyde-inducing fame and egoboost. 

I wonder, at what level of fame does a person begin to think they are above the rule of decency, and most importantly, the rule of personal responsibility?
