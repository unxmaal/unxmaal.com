I truly loathe comment-spammers, as they&#8217;re following what has to be the stupidest marketing idea ever. 

Check out [Trencaspammer][1], which forces commenters to enter in a security code before accepting comments. It should be a nice stopgap measure against comment spam, at least until WordPress 1.3 is released.

Oh yeah, the site is in Spanish, but the installation instructions are in English, and it&#8217;s not that hard to install. Edit your wp-comment-* files, and add the plugin, and you&#8217;re done.
