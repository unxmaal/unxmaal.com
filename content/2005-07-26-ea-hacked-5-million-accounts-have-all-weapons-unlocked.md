From the EA official forums:

> &#8220;Well, what a wonderful few days it has been. Since EA didn&#8217;t take the time to respond (or maybe even read) our emails about various stats-server security holes, it clearly showed us how much they care. Therefore, we came to the conclusion that modifying 5 million accounts wouldn&#8217;t be that big of a deal.
> 
> That being said, accounts with ids from 40,000,000 to 45,000,000 now have all of their weapons unlocked.
> 
> What will be next week? Perhaps we&#8217;ll give everyone their Distinguished Service Medal, or maybe we&#8217;ll elevate everyone to the rank of Sergeant Major.
> 
> The ball&#8217;s in your court, EA. Time&#8217;s up at the buzzer, how well will you play?&#8221;
