Laura got a [T-Mobile Blackberry 7100t][1] today, so the betting pool on when I&#8217;ll have one is officially open. 

Here&#8217;s some frenzied Crackberry links:

>   * [MobileWhack][2] has quite a bit of info. 
>   * Jason O&#8217;Grady has a 3-part series on his move to a Blackberry, and most of it is OSX-related: [I][3], [II][4], and [III][5].
