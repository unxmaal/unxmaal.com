A few hours after I moved the last boxes of junk from my old apartment into my new house, I was laid off from my job as a network engineer. 

It sucks, but I knew it would happen sooner or later. Sprint had been holding the layoff axe over our heads for over a year and a half, and the latest round of rumors convinced me to really start looking for other employment.

I&#8217;ve got severance pay for a good while, and quite a few resumes sent out. I&#8217;ve also scheduled my CCNA exam for the middle of March &#8212;something I should have done &#8230; three years ago. 

If any of you folks in the Atlanta area can recommend recruiting agencies or have any leads for me, please let me know.

And if you&#8217;re hiring, [hire me][1].
