Yay! I made it to Atlanta, and have mostly settled in, although I can&#8217;t find my microwave. 

Email and posts will be spotty for the next few days. The whole apartment complex gets its cablemodem service through [Charter Cable][1]. &#8220;Charter&#8221; is a Latin word that means &#8220;festering goat feces.&#8221; 

[Ryder][2] Truck Rental Services sucks, too. Not in a mild, breezy way, but in a chaotic vortex of doom way. It was ok that the truck was filthy, late, and the wrong size. It was ok that it was missing a mudflap and the reverse-beepy-thing. It was, however, **not** ok that the truck was overdue for maintenance, or that the truck&#8217;s tires were so worn that it constantly vibrated and veered left. 

Ryder and Charter: companies from the Abyss.
