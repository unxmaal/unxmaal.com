Grr. My three-day weekend ended with a grumpy &#8216;Add me to your Do Not Call List&#8217;, as I got a courtesy wakeup call from the nice folks at [Edge Teleservices][1]. Edge is the third telemarketing company &#8216;representing&#8217; [DirecTV][2] that I&#8217;ve requested not to call my home in as many weeks. If I ever had any desire to purchase DirecTV service, be guaranteed that I don&#8217;t now. 

I wonder if [this][3] is the home telephone number and street address of Art Calhoun, the Edge Teleservices manager? I hope not. It seems to me that someone whose primary occupation is the invasion of the privacy of others would strive for quite a bit of their own privacy.
