Mmmm, stats for you car: Davis manufactures the [CarChip][1], which is a small device that plugs into your car&#8217;s diagnostic connector and gathers all sorts of fun data as you drive. When you&#8217;re finished driving, disconnect the CarChip from your car, and connect it to your PC to download the collected data. 

From the site:

&#8220;CarChip fits all 1996 and later foreign and domestic vehicles to automatically record and store 75 hours of trip details, including:
:     * Time, date and distance for each trip 
          * Speed logged every 5 seconds 
              * Hard acceleration and decelerations 
                  * Engine diagnostic trouble codes and status of other engine parameters when the code occurred 
                      * Idle time 
                          * Time and date CarChip is connected or disconnected. </ul> </dd> </dl>
