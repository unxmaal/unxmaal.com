I watched <A HREF="http://www.stenterprise.com/">Enterprise</A> Wednesday night &#8211; conveniently time-shifted by my beloved [Tivo][1]. I thought it to be the best Star Trek pilot made yet. This doesn&#8217;t say much: I still have occasional terrible memories of &#8220;Encounter at Farpoint.&#8221; And yes, the theme song was definitely stolen from some deodorant commercial. 

So what did you think about &#8220;<A HREF="http://www.stenterprise.com/">Enterprise</A>: starring ThatQuantumLeapGuy and Jolene Blaylock&#8217;s Nipples&#8221; ?
