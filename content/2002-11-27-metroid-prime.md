[Metroid Prime][1] rocks. 

After playing for an hour-ish each day, I&#8217;ve gotten to the third boss, Thardus. He throws rocks at you, freezes you, and occasionally turns into an invincible ball and tries to squash you. After he painted the room with my greasy entrails the first time, I discovered that he was, indeed, easy to beat. The very simple trick is to jump up onto one of the ledges on the sides of the room, stay fairly still, and shoot the hell out of him. He&#8217;ll continue to occasionally turn into a huge ball and squash you, but at most he&#8217;ll only take off a hundred points. The ledge keeps you out of the way of his freezing attack. Also, it&#8217;s a lot easier to keep a target lock on him while you&#8217;re standing still. 

Poetry, inspired by Thardus: _[Thardus&#8230; My Be-otch][2]_.
