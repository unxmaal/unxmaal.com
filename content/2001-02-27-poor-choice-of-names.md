Driving to the <a href="http://www.mciworldcom.com/" target="_blank">customer</a>&#8216;s site this morning, I spotted a sign claiming credit for some work that <a href="http://www.blandlandscaping.com/" target="_blank">this company</a> had done. Am I the only one who thinks they could have chosen a name with a better boding for their business?
