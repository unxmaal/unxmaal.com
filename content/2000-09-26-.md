Hated Flash Site of the Day Award goes to [Aiwa.com][1]. 

I&#8217;m really wondering if there is any way these people could make their site more unnavigable. I hope that someone drags the designer out into the street to be shot. Actually, this may have already happened, as it doesn&#8217;t appear that the Retailers section has been updated since 1996. 

Even if their site does suck, I still want their [MP3 player][2].
