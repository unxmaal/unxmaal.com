Again I&#8217;d like to state how much Charter Cable &#8211; AKA <A HREF="http://www.hsacorp.net/">HSA</A> &#8211; sucks. I opened a trouble ticket on Friday to replace my shoddy cablemodem, and as of this afternoon the local office had no idea that anything was wrong. 

I do take malevolent glee in the fact that HSA&#8217;s stock is down to $0.37 a [share][1].
