I heart Pine. Today I saved a coworker a lot of time by explaining Pine&#8217;s batch-apply commands.



Say you want to move all emails containing the string &#8220;monkeys&#8221; in the subject line to another mail folder. These are the commands to enter:



; to enter Selection Commands

B Broaden Selection

T select based on Text

S select text in the Subject line

type in the string of text you&#8217;re searching for, and hit Enter.



You&#8217;ll notice all the selected mails have an X by them now. Enter the following commands next:

A Apply Command

S Save selected messages

type in the name of the folder in which you want the messages saved.
