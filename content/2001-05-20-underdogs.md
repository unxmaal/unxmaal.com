Robert found the <A HREF="http://www.theunderdogs.org/">Underdogs</A> site, which is a repository and encyclopedia of historic games. Underdogs finds computer games from as early as the 70s, games that have been released as freeware or otherwise released into the public domain, and preserves and promotes them. 

From their [About][1] section: &#8220;_Home of the Underdogs is a non-profit site dedicated to the preservation and promotion of underrated PC games (and a few non-PC games) of all ages: good games that deserve a second chance after dismal sales or critical reviews that we feel are unwarranted_.&#8221;

Anyone remember [M.U.L.E.][2]? They have it. 

Remember [One Must Fall 2097][3]? Yep, that too.
