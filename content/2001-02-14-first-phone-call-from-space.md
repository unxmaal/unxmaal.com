On February 10th, 2001 at approximately 4:09 PM CST, using laptop-based [Cisco IP SoftPhone][1] on the Space Shuttle Atlantis, Astronaut Marsha Ivin made the first and second telephone calls _ever_ from space. 

After confirming with the Flight Commander, Marsha started SoftPhone and at approximately 4:09PM made a call to the Flight Director. The call went from her SoftPhone software through a VG-200 gateway, over an FXO port, through a PBX to the phone on the Flight Director&#8217;s desk. At the end Marsha called one of the [Cisco 7960 phones][2] in the Payload Operations Center, which was answered by Brett Parrish, lead NASA engineer on this project. Marsha asked &#8220;So how do you like getting the second ever call from space?&#8221;.
