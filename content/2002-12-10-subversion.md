&#8220;Let me at least explain to you why I feel this is necessary. You see, I reread this post, and I felt a real fear. A clambering, slithering, nauseated fear that someday, I will end up imprisoned or even dead because I suggested this. The fact that I can feel that fear, a fear that threatens to make me silent, to shut me up in the face of what I think is wrong in America is the greatest reason I can think of to suggest this.&#8221;
