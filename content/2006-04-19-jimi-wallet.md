I consider this [Jimi??????? wallet][1]. I don&#8217;t really like the transparent plastic-ness of it, but I do like the size, and the fact that it forces you to carry _less_ instead of more. 

My wonderful Fossil front-pocket wallet, purchased in 1998, finally bit the dust several months ago. I searched several places for a replacement, only to find that Fossil stopped making that particular type. The only type they had left was actually too small, with barely any room at all.
