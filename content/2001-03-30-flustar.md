[FluStar][1] is a neat system that uses a &#8220;comprehensive influenza surveillance network sponsored by Roche Pharmaceuticals&#8221;. Put in your ZIP code and see how likely it is to catch the flu in your area. 

On a side note, I&#8217;m thinking a great advertising motto for this site would be &#8220;Get FluStared!&#8221;
