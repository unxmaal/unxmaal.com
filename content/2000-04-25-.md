Neat. I guess I&#8217;m running a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jester.com/Entertain/tech_ENCulture.htm">E/N</a> website. I didn&#8217;t know there was a categorization until about five minutes ago. 

_&#8220;An E/N site is about everything and nothing. The page has no apparent purpose: the webmaster or webmasters run it because they feel like it. They write about whatever they want, and they don&#8217;t care if their audience visits or not.&#8221;_
