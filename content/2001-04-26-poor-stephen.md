Never read webpages right after you&#8217;ve woken up. 

When I first saw this Wired headline, _<A title="Mucus! She hardly KNOWS us!" HREF="http://www.wired.com/news/medtech/0,1286,43210,00.html">Hawking Mucus On the Net</A>_, my first thought was &#8220;Why in the hell would [Stephen][1] allow his own bodily fluids to be sold [online][2]?
