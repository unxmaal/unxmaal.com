Business tip for today: when you have a world-famous, instantly-recognizeable [brand name][1], change it. 

I mean really, you can&#8217;t have people _buying_ your products. That might actually make _money_, and jeez, what would you do with that?

Instead of the simple, four-letter &#8220;Palm&#8221;, the insipid twits in Palm&#8217;s management spent two years in business meetings to come up with their new company name, &#8220;<a href=http://palmone.com/">PalmOne</a>. Brilliant. And the lower-case L is the numeral 1. **On purpose**.

They were probably drinking &#8220;[New Coke][2]&#8221; the whole time.

PalmOne. It&#8217;s like Palm tried to sign onto IRC and someone else had their nickname, so they changed it to something &#8216;leet&#8217;.
