Hmmm&#8230; here&#8217;s some interesting [Terminator 3 rumors][1]: Apparently, director James Cameron may come back to do the flick after the completion of _Hannibal_. It also appears that the cast from the first two movies may be involved, including Arnie, Linda, and Edward. 

More: &#8220;_Based on previously reported info, the third film&#8217;s story will be set in the present day and will focus on the first battle between humanity and Skynet, which paves the way for the major war to come._&#8221;
