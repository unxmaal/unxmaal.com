Seeing canned palak paneer at Cost Plus World Market got me thinking that surely $3.99/can was highway robbery, and surely it&#8217;d be cheaper on the Interweb &#8212; I mean, CPWM has to order that stuff from _somewhere_. 

After some digging, I found [iShopIndian.com][1], which seems to have some really good prices for most of the Indian and Asian food that I&#8217;d otherwise get from Whole Foods. For example, their palak paneer is $1.99, which is cheap even after I add in shipping.
