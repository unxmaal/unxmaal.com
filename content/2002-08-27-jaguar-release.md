Friday night, [Laura][1] and I went to Apple&#8217;s &#8220;100 Minutes of Jaguar&#8221; release party at Lenox Mall. We anticipated about 80 people being there. When we got there at about 10:15, there were about 1000 people lined up throughout the top floor of the mall, almost all of them waiting to get their copy of Mac OS 10.2. Rather than getting in line, we decided to just sit and watch for a little while. When we left at 11PM, more people were showing up. 

Check out the write-up on [CoolMacintosh][2], and if you look carefully at [this][3] picture, you can see my head poking up above a tree in the center right.
