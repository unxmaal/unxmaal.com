In the 1970s, French scientists discovered that uranium samples from the [Oklo Uranium][1] mine in Gabon, Africa, had an abnormally low amount of the isotope U-235. In some places, the uranium found at Oklo contained only half the amount of the isotope that should have been there. After further study, it was determined that the Uranium deposits at Oklo acted as a [natural nuclear reactor][2].
