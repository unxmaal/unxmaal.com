I guess my main problem with [Net Authority][1]&#8216;s Offender Database is that they don&#8217;t provide me with links to offending sites. I&#8217;d really like to check these sites out for myself. Hey, wait a minute. Maybe this whole NA thing is just a clever ruse designed to harvest a list of all the really interesting sites&#8230; 

Hey kids: know of a deviant, blasphemous site on the net? Send them a warning from the [Net Authority][2]!
