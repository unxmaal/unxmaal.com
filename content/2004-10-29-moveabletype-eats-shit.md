I&#8217;ve removed mt-comments.cgi entirely, because MT eats shit.

Comment-spammers using a distributed denial-of-service technique effectively took down the server today. 

I&#8217;ll be switching to [WordPress][1] this weekend.

If you use MoveableType, I seriously recommend removing it _today_.
