A while back, I suggested we paint the bathroom <font color=green>green</font>, because anything would&#8217;ve been better than the nasty, soul-sucking [blue-grey][1] that the bathroom had been painted in since the early 70s. 

At the time, I was joking, but I think it turned out [quite nicely][2]. I want to continue the Tiki theme, adding a bamboo print border, and eventually replacing the toilet and bathtub with rattan replicas. Within a few years, perhaps I can make defecating in my bathroom a truly tropical experience, replete with strange diseases and mysterious insects eager to inflict and explore supporating wounds. 

Now where would I get some tigers for under the lavatory?
