Somebody posted to [NANOG][1] a pretty useful [tool][2] for finding basic information on a telco central office given an NPA/NXX (that&#8217;s an area code / prefix pair for the unl33t).

I seem to remember a tool on [speakeasy][3]&#8216;s pages that gave far more info, but it&#8217;s lost in the mists of memory. Should have blogged it.
