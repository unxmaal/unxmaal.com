If you&#8217;re a tech, you&#8217;ve probably run into Windows NT, 2K, or XP machines that have had unknown Administrator passwords, especially in the case of job turnover. This situation can be extremely frustrating, and can waste a lot of your time trying to fix. 

Check out pnordahl&#8217;s [Offline NT Password Recovery Disk][1]. It&#8217;s a free Linux-based boot image that can be written to either floppy or CD, and allows a tech to change passwords for any account on a Windows NT-based machine, as well as perform registry editing. 

I consider this to be an indispensible tool of the trade.
