[Rick][1] found a concise listing of a utility I&#8217;ve used in the past, but forgot to link. 

Ever forget your NT Administrator password? Attempt to work on a system with a lost password? Check out the <A HREF="http://home.eunet.no/~pnordahl/ntpasswd/">Offline NT Password & Registry Editor</A>, which is a snazzy little Linux bootdisk utility that allows you to access NTFS partitions and modify the stored encrypted passwords.
