I find it so amusing that the <A HREF="http://www.bbbonline.org/">Better Business Bureau</a>&#8216;s online page title reads &#8220;BBBOnLine, Inc. &#8212; Promoting Trust and Confidence on the Internet.&#8221; 

Come on, guys. This is the same site whose &#8220;Hyperlinking Policy&#8221; supposedly only allows links &#8220;_from entities that are information sources or public service-oriented, such as news media organizations, government agencies and search engines._&#8221; In other words, the BBB don&#8217;t want no links from no filthy plebeian sites like [this one][1]. 

The idiocy and ignorance of this policy overwhelms me. Not only is it simply a bad idea, it&#8217;s bad technology, a prohibition that is so easily circumvented that the circumvention itself might be accidental. The BBB&#8217;s reasoning (if gelid-brained sphincter-mining could be considered reasoning) is that some poor, confused person might misinterpret information found on the BBB&#8217;s site due to the links said person traversed to get there. 

To me, this seems a way of passing blame: &#8220;No, our content isn&#8217;t illegible, illiterate bunk. It&#8217;s perfectly understandable, but only so if you start browsing at our main page, then navigate through forty pages of our mind-numbing, will-sucking site. Of course, by then your frontal lobes will have been seared to pulsating goop, and you wouldn&#8217;t have the capacity for free thought and/or literate interpretation, but that&#8217;s the general idea. It saves on staff writers.&#8221;
