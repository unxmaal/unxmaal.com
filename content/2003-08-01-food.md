Parenthetically, isn&#8217;t it great being a slob AND being forgetful at the same time? It&#8217;s always a pleasant surprise when you look down and find some spare food. &#8220;Hey look! A piece of pepperoni I missed! And since it&#8217;s on my man-teat and not the floor, it&#8217;s perfectly edible!!&#8221;
