Given the VIN of an ordered MINI Cooper, you can paste it into the Wallenius Wilhelmsen [cargo tracking page][1] and locate the name of the ship that carries said MINI, as well as estimated departure and arrival dates.

It shows that the vessel containing my MINI, the Curitiba, has sailed, and is due to arrive in Charleston, SC on 3-30. This could change, because the shipping terminal info is a little hedgy until the ship proves to be underway.

Here&#8217;s a photo of the [Curitiba][2].

You can search the [Coast Guard PSIX][3] page for information on the ship, as shown [here][4]. 

Once you get the ship&#8217;s call sign, and after the ship&#8217;s been out to sea for a few days, you can check the [Ocean Weather][5] site for the ship&#8217;s exact location by checking the [Marine Observation Tables][6], or just looking for the call-sign on one of the [maps][7].
