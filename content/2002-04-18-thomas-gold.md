Per [Thomas Gold][1], Professor Emeritus of Astronomy at Cornell University, in his book [The Deep Hot Biosphere][2], it is a myth that oil comes from dead things [like squished dinosaurs]. Instead, oil is produced by bacteriological processes deep within the Earth&#8217;s crust. This concept answers several questions with the current concept of oil generation, such as: &#8220;how can there be oil on asteroids, if there were no organic matter to make it from?&#8221; &#8220;Why do dry wells fill up?&#8221; &#8220;Why can we find oil literally anywhere on the planet if we drill deep enough?&#8221; &#8220;How could there possibly have ever been enough biological matter present under the exact conditions necessary to produce oil?&#8221; 

Interesting questions, indeed, and more to the point: if it is proven that oil is being produced at a steady rate of near-kilotons by deep-dwelling bacterial blooms, how will this affect society? How much of the truth is known now and suppressed by governments and industries needing to maintain imagined scarcity in order to reap profit?
