Yesterday I helped Simon remove about a billion nasty spyware maggots from a freshly-installed Win2k machine. He thinks that over the course of time, Microsoft OSes will come to have &#8220;allowed&#8221; spyware &#8212; effectively spyware that is not detected by Microsoft&#8217;s built-in, &#8220;approved&#8221; spyware detector. the question is, how much would Microsoft have to stand to profit before it compromised on protecting its customers? (I&#8217;d say somewhere around $2, at least.)

Today I find a little gem on the Register indicating Microsoft&#8217;s spyware detector has downgraded Claria&#8217;s spyware from &#8220;quarantine&#8221; to &#8220;ignore&#8221;.
