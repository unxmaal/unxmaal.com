Here&#8217;s a hint, Mr. Kerry: If you want to win votes, you&#8217;ll police the assclowns at johnkerry.com to keep them from filling up my logfiles with fake referrals. 

Not that you had my vote in the first place, you communist swine.

Oh, and look, it&#8217;s an AOL IP:  
host 172.132.98.191  
191.98.132.172.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer AC8462BF.ipt.aol.com.

Typical.
