Yeah, more embarrassment for me: I&#8217;ve recently grown this terrible affinity for SCOTS: [Southern Culture on the Skids][1]. 

Couple the manic riffs of psychobilly punk with the homey romance of microwaved meals and trailer parks, and you&#8217;re really close to the sounds I&#8217;m talking about. Of course, then you have to take a sharp left at <A HREF="http://maps.yahoo.com/py/maps.py?BFCat=&#038;Pyt=Tmap&#038;newFL=Use Address Below&#038;addr=100 main st&#038;csz=pumpkin center%2C al&#038;country=us&#038;Get%A0Map=Get Map">Pumpkin Center, Alabama</A>, drive through forty miles of dirt roads, and bash your head with bricks a few times. 

Yes, this music did reduce [Kelli][2] into a quivering pulpy mess. My work here is done.
