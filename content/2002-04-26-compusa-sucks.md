[CompUSA][1] Sucks. 

Yesterday, Robert and I stopped by CompUSA. Once at the register, the cashier informed us that there would be a 5 minute wait before we could be helped, as someone had just made a very large cash purchase. Rather than waiting, my friend put his purchase back on the shelf. I told the cashier to inform his management that the arbitrary hold-time due to the large cash purchase just cost Compusa about $200. The cashier then stated that his management was much happier about the large cash purchase and wasn&#8217;t very concerned about the loss of $200. I then advised the cashier to inform his management that while the hold-time cost Compusa $200, the cashier&#8217;s poor attitude cost Compusa two customers.

Today, Friday, April 26, I thought better of my refusal to shop at Compusa. &#8220;Perhaps the cashier was simply having a bad day.&#8221; I reached the store at 8:55 PM &#8211;very close to closing time, but the store hours clearly indicate that the store closes at 9PM. There were several customers still inside, shopping. When I reached the door, an employee named &#8216;Mandy&#8217; stepped up to the doors, and held them closed. 

&#8220;We&#8217;re closed,&#8221; she said. I looked at my watch. 

&#8220;It&#8217;s five minutes till nine. It&#8217;ll take me 5 minutes to buy this video card.&#8221; 

&#8220;No, we&#8217;re CLOSED!&#8221; Mandy said, and then turned around in a huff, and went back to her stand by the door. I tapped on the glass. &#8220;Please let me speak with your supervisor.&#8221;

&#8220;WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME?!&#8221; screamed Mandy. &#8220;I TOLD YOU WE&#8217;RE CLOSED! GO AWAY!&#8221; 

I was taken aback. This was highly unprofessional, and very insulting. &#8220;Let me speak to your supervisor, now.&#8221; Mandy ran away to get her supervisor. 

Moments later, her supervisor, &#8216;Da&#8211;&#8216;, appeared. &#8220;Sir, we&#8217;re closed.&#8221; I checked my watch. 

&#8220;It&#8217;s 9:02. You weren&#8217;t closed when I got here. Furthermore, this employee just screamed at me and told me to go away,&#8221; I said.

&#8220;I don&#8217;t care about that and there&#8217;s nothing I can do about it. We&#8217;re closed,&#8221; replied Da&#8211;. She refused to contact any other manager, and then turned around and walked away. 

This is disgraceful conduct for any person, much less a CompUSA employee. Additionally, this was the second day in a row that I have been insulted and offended by employees working at this store. 

I expect a full written explanation of this incident from the general manager responsible for this store. I expect a written apology letter from both employees, if they are permitted to continue working for the company. Even then, I am unsure of whether or not I will consider shopping at CompUSA again.
