[Skype][1] has been out for a while, but I&#8217;ve only just started playing with it. So far, I&#8217;m very impressed.

Skype is a free voice-over-Internet client. It lets you make phone-quality voice &#8216;calls&#8217; to other Skype users, for free. The &#8216;free&#8217; thing is a big seller, for me. Skype does have a for-pay option of calling land-line, regular numbers, but I haven&#8217;t tried that yet.

The application install and setup was very easy, and the sound quality is suprisingly good. I&#8217;m using it with my iBook, which has an integrated microphone. If you use it with your PC, you may need to attach an external mike. 

Overall, Skype is a great app, and is great tech. If you haven&#8217;t tried it, I highly recommend it, especially if you have family that live far away. Free beats paying long-distance charges any day.
