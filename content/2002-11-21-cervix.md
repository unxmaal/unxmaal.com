Robert: It just seems like there&#8217;s a lot of interesting things happening lately. Like, I read this article about a vaccine that will completely cure a certain form of cancer.

Robert: Doesn&#8217;t do me much good, of course, because you have to be a girl to have a cervix.

Me: Well, uh.. actually, I should tell you that I have a cervix.

Me: It&#8217;s in the fridge, behind the mayo. Don&#8217;t knock it over.

Robert: I can&#8217;t believe&#8230;. No, wait. I _can_ believe that you have a cervix. You jackass.
