Today came with a discovery of a great Indian restaurant: [Daabha][1] Indian Cafe, located at 2772 Cumberland Blvd. The cafe is in the small shopping plaza on the left past the intersection of Spring Road and Cumberland, just past McDonald&#8217;s. 

Today I had &#8220;diced chicken with red peppers&#8221;, and when they say &#8220;red peppers&#8221;, they really mean it. The food itself was excellent, and the buttered [naan][2] bread was absolutely wonderful. Overall, the little restaurant was very clean and tidy, and the service was very quick. A meal will costs more than fast food, at around $10 a plate, but the large portions and wonderful flavorings are well worth the price. If you&#8217;re in North Atlanta and looking for Indian cuisine, I highly recommend you stop by.
