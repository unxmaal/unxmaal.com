Now before you flame me (pun intended) for saying &#8220;Art guys are gay&#8230;&#8221; My <A HREF="http://www.howdesign.com/">HOW Design Magazine</A> told me so. I figured that might not be enough supporting information for our dear unxmaal.com readers, so I visited <A HREF="http://www.google.com/">Google</A> and tried &#8220;<A HREF="http://www.google.com/search?q=gay+design+art">gay design art</A>&#8221; as my search string. The first hit returned was a former employer, <A HREF="http://www.hiwaay.net/">Hiwaaaaay Information Services</A> &#8212; I was only there 90 days, so I never got to meet all the <A HREF="http://www.wondergeeks.net/">prissy webdesigners</A>.
