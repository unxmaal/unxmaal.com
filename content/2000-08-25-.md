No! Hooray for ME!! I am the prowd owner of one of an Aiwa [CDC-MP3][1]. I installed it last night and I&#8217;m loving it so far. I&#8217;m currently playing a CD-RW full of raver kid music as a test (well ok not currently but when I&#8217;m in the car). I&#8217;ll probably get around to posting a half assed review next week after I&#8217;ve banged on it a bit.

oh and COULD SOMEONE PLEASE STOP THAT INCESSANT BLINKING?!?!
