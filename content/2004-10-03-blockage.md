> &#8220;There was a girl in the hospital Friday that had to have part of her colon taken out due to a blockage. (When you get a blockage, the poop can&#8217;t move, the bowel dies and becomes rotten, and you have to have it taken out).

> She eats her hair &#8212; just pulls it out and eats it. But it doesn&#8217;t get digested, like a cat digesting its own hair. Her hair just rolled up and stayed there, like a huge ball of twine.&#8221;
