If you&#8217;re one of the unlucky few who&#8217;ve had problems with your iPod battery, you can buy a replacement iPod battery from [iPodBattery.com][1]. 

[Laura][2] had some weird problems with her iPod. For some reason iTunes wouldn&#8217;t update the play count of songs that she&#8217;d listened to after she installed the newest iPod software. I wiped and reinstalled the software, and now it works fine. 

I&#8217;ll try this TrackBack thing with a link to CGP&#8217;s [post][3]. If that doesn&#8217;t work, go poke [CapsGetPeeled][4] for some linky luvvin.
