> [The Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon][1] is the phenomenon where one happens upon some obscure piece of information???????? often an unfamiliar word or name???????? and soon afterwards encounters the same subject again, often repeatedly. Anytime the phrase &#8220;That&#8217;s so weird, I just heard about that the other day&#8221; would be appropriate, the utterer is hip-deep in Baader-Meinhof.

That&#8217;ll explain why you&#8217;ll hear a lot about [Scandinavian death metal][2] in the next few weeks.
