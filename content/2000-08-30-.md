Just realized that there was a site using blogger that Eric doesn&#8217;t know about (at least, not that I know of) &#8211; [**domesticat.net**][1]. This is Amy&#8217;s site, a good friend. The quantity of similarities between us is very disturbing, but I love her anyways. Truly a [wondergeek][2] at heart.
