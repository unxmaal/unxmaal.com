In reference to [this post][1], yeah, [AppRocket][2] sucks.

It&#8217;s fairly good as a launcher &#8212; better than most, but it still gets confused by multiple matching Start Menu items. For example, if you type &#8216;FIR&#8217;, intending to launch Firefox, AppRocket will show you multiple instances of Firefox: one for &#8220;All users&#8221;, and one for your account. Overall, the program is no [Quicksilver][3].

It still would&#8217;ve been a keeper had it not been ninja-payware. Nowhere on the AppRocket webpage or on the download page is anything listed about how the app will self-destruct after about a month if you don&#8217;t buy it. I&#8217;ve checked all around the site and still see nothing about this auto-expiry. 

I really, really hate ninja-payware. If a developer doesn&#8217;t have the balls to **tell me** that I have to **buy** its product, instead sneaking in an auto-expiration &#8220;feature&#8221;, it seems to me said developer has little faith in both its own product.
