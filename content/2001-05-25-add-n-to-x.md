In 1994, when I was in tenth grade at Bradshaw High School, there was one programming problem that I could never figure out. For years, I&#8217;ve occasionally pulled that problem out and toyed with it: reversing a sequence of numbers. A few nights ago, as I went to sleep, I came up with the solution.

#include < stdio.h >

int main(void) {

> long foo= 0, bar = 0, x = 0;
> 
> printf(&#8220;Enter a number: &#8220;);  
> scanf(&#8220;%li&#8221;, &foo);
> 
> while (foo > 0) {  
> x = foo % 10;  
> foo = foo / 10;  
> bar = (bar*10)+x;  
> }
> 
> printf(&#8220;This is bar: %li\n&#8221;, bar);  
> return(0);
