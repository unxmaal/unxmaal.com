I love [Junkscience.com][1].

They&#8217;ve just proven that, by Ben&Jerry&#8217;s own reasoning, their ice cream is [&#8220;unsafe&#8221;][2] and should be taken off the market.

> Ben & Jerry&#8217;s promotional literature, available at its &#8220;scoop shops&#8221; and on its web site, states, &#8220;Dioxin is known to cause cancer, genetic and reproductive defects and learning disabilities&#8230; The only safe level of dioxin exposure is no exposure at all.&#8221; Dioxin is a by-product of industrial processes and may also be created naturally through combustion of plant materials. 
> 
> &#8220;The level of dioxin in a single serving of the Ben & Jerry&#8217;s World&#8217;s Best Vanilla Ice Cream tested was almost 200 times greater than the &#8220;virtually safe [daily] dose&#8221; determined by the EPA.
> 
> &#8220;Ben & Jerry&#8217;s and Greenpeace, the company&#8217;s source for information on dioxin, have concluded that dioxin is not safe at any level.&#8221;  
> &#8220;If dioxin is so dangerous, perhaps Ben & Jerry&#8217;s should remove its ice cream from the market until it is &#8216;safe,&#8217; consistent with the company&#8217;s promotional literature.&#8221;
