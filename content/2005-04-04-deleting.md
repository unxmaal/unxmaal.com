In between things, which is always the worst times now, in between things, I&#8217;m deleting photos and messages and proof of the last two years. 

Except I&#8217;m not deleting them. I&#8217;m putting them into password-protected compressed folders labelled &#8220;Don&#8217;t look at this.&#8221; 

I can&#8217;t bear to forget. Or to remember.
