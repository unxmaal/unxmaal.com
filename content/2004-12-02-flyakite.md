For those of you still suffering in the pits of WinXP-Hell, you can install [Flyakite][1] and make your PC look almost like it&#8217;s running OSX. 

(This app is rather like looking at penises from a distance, but not actually _touching_ them with your face. You&#8217;re not _quite_ gay, but you&#8217;re very envious of homosexuals.)

I&#8217;ve installed it on my WinXP SP2 machine, and have had no problems so far, other than one of the default fonts being pretty ugly [Lucida Console? Wha?]. If you decide to use it, you **must** turn off System Restore first.
