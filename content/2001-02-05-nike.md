I&#8217;ve owned perhaps two pairs of [Nike][1] shoes in my life, and both pairs fell apart within two months of purchase. It&#8217;s nice to know that Nike is such a big proponent of &#8220;[freedom to choose and freedom to express who you are.][2]&#8221; that they refuse to deliver requests for personalized shoes bearing the word &#8220;<A HREF="http://shey.net/niked.html">sweatshop.</A>&#8220;
