I&#8217;ve been fairly pleased with <a xhref="http://www.rootkit.nl/">rootkit hunter</a>.???? It&#8217;s trivial to set up, self-updating, and easy to use.

Fairly often in my career, I&#8217;ve started a job as an additional sysadmin, or worse yet, a replacement sysadmin. I rarely have the luxury of setting up a system or a network from scratch. It&#8217;s always difficult to determine the security level of a given system, and I rarely [never] have been able to treat production systems as &#8220;untrusted&#8221; and take them down long enough to do a full audit.

Granted, you should always treat the output from an &#8216;all in one&#8217; tool like rkhunter with a grain of salt, but it does act well as an additional tool to use when you need it.
