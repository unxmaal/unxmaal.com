Operator: &#8220;[Apartment complex] Emergency Services, how may I help you?&#8221;

Me: &#8220;Yeah&#8230; I&#8217;ve got an emergency.&#8221;

Operator: &#8220;Ok?&#8221;

Me: &#8220;Well, the front gate to the apartment complex isn&#8217;t working and it&#8217;s locked a lot of people out. This happens once a week.&#8221;

Operator: &#8220;I&#8217;ll page someone out right away.&#8221;

Me: &#8220;That&#8217;s not really the emergency.&#8221;

Operator: &#8220;Oh.. ok?&#8221;

Me: &#8220;This is kind of embarassing..&#8221;

Operator: &#8220;Go ahead.. &#8221;

Me: &#8220;I just drank a huge bottle of water and .. well.. I _really_ have to pee.&#8221;

Operator: &#8220;Uhh&#8230; &#8221;

Me: &#8220;I really _have_ to pee. Like now.&#8221;

Operator: &#8220;Well, sir, maybe you could wait until the repair person&#8211;&#8221;

Me: &#8220;&#8211;No, this is an _emergency_, which is why I called you.&#8221;

Operator: &#8220;Oh, well, I &#8211;&#8221;

Me: &#8220;What&#8217;s your name?&#8221;

Operator: &#8220;Uhh it&#8217;s Ellen.&#8221;

Me: &#8220;Ok, good, Ellen, I was wondering if you could recommend any good place for me to go?&#8221; 

Operator: &#8220;Oh no, I don&#8217;t think I could &#8211;&#8221;

Me: &#8220;If you thought it&#8217;d be ok for me to just go over by this tree here, I could go, and if anyone asked I&#8217;d just say that you said it&#8217;d be ok.&#8221;

Operator: &#8220;No, no! I don&#8217;t &#8211;&#8221;

Me: &#8220;Ok well what about sorta around the side of the building?&#8221;

Operator: &#8220;I uhh..&#8221;

Me: &#8220;Look, Ellen, I&#8217;m seriously damaging my bladder here. I&#8217;m dying.&#8221;

Operator: &#8220;I&#8217;m terribly&#8211;&#8221;

Me: &#8220;Well since this gate locks up once a week, don&#8217;t you guys have a procedure for handling emergencies like this?&#8221;

Operator: &#8220;Sir, I&#8217;m so sorry, but I just..&#8221;

Me: [grunting] &#8220;Ok I&#8217;ve got to go _right now_!&#8221;

I put the cellphone down on the sidewalk, and pour a thin stream of water out of my water bottle onto the pavement.

Operator: &#8220;Oh my.. oh, sir.. I &#8211;&#8221;

Me: &#8220;Ok, well, emergency&#8217;s over now. Thanks, Ellen. And when the repair guy gets here, see if you can get him to clean up the puddle. Bye!&#8221;
