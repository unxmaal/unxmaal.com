If Christmas music hasn&#8217;t irritated you sufficiently, I suggest checking out the songs from the [Vib Ribbon][1] soundtrack. 

These seven songs are supposedly made by a J-Pop band called &#8220;Laugh and Beats&#8221;. Although I can&#8217;t find any reference to the band outside of this soundtrack, I&#8217;m sure they really exist, though they probably went into hiding after the game&#8217;s release. The music itself can be described as what would happen if you dosed a couple hundred giggly Japanese girls with forty pounds of [CIA][2]-grade [MDMA][3], forced them to watch 48 hours&#8217; worth of Loony Toons cartoons, then let them loose in [Moby][4]&#8216;s recording studio.

I heart this music. No, really. I do.
