I didn&#8217;t realize Cisco had such an <A HREF="http://www.convergedigest.com/Mergers/mergersCisco.htm">appetite</A>. 



I found this page while searching for &#8220;<A HREF="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&#038;q=cisco+mica+conexant">cisco mica conexant</A>&#8221; on google. Our 3Com <A HREF="http://www.commworks.com/Wired_Access/Total_Control_Platform/Total_Control_1000/">TotalContral</A> dial concentrator is showing its age, and the support contracts aren&#8217;t cheap&#8230; so I&#8217;m trying to figure out which access servers work best nowadays with the wide range of modems.



Ever tried to use a crappy [win]modem? What brand was it? As frustrating as this stuff can be, I&#8217;ve got to find the least expensive way to cover as many crappy modems as possible.
