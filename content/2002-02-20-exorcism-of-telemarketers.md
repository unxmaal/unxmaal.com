[Beth][1] has recently had some fun run-ins with telemarketers lately. As I told her, never waste your own time venting spleen on a telemarketer. Every time you hang up on, scream at, yell obscenities at, or argue with a telemarketer, you waste your own time. Telemarketers _will_ call back eventually, regardless of how mean you&#8217;ve been to them, unless you follow a very precise set of legally-binding procedures. Consider these procedures to be a form of modern-day exorcism. 

Rather than wasting your time screaming, read the Junkbusters &#8220;[Telemarketers][2]&#8221; info page, and be sure to have the [Junkbusters Anti-Telemarketing Script][3] within easy reach of every phone in your house. If you follow these procedures each time you get a telemarketing call, you will eliminate almost all of them. 

A few additional tips I can give is that you should ensure you obtain the telemarketer&#8217;s name and callback number as early in the conversation as possible. This way, if the telemarketer hangs up on you once you begin The Script, you can call back and request to speak to management. Also, be sure to demand a copy of the telemarketing company&#8217;s &#8220;Do Not Call&#8221; procedure, and a written statement that they have removed you from their lists. Even if you forget The Script, these two steps will eliminate the great portion of unwanted calls.
