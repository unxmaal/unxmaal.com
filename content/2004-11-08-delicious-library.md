Delicious Monster&#8217;s [Delicious Library][1] app is supposed to be released today, and I&#8217;ve been counting down the minutes. What does this app do?

What doesn&#8217;t it do?

&#8220;Delicious Library&#8217;s digital shelves act as a visual card-catalog of your books, movies, music and video games.&#8221; It&#8217;ll scan in these items using your Apple iSight camera to read the bar code. No, really. 

And of course, it has all the other good stuff you&#8217;d expect from a library-type app, including voice-activated catalog searches, iPod-synced catalog lists, user ratings, and recommendations. 

Vaporware? We&#8217;ll know today.
