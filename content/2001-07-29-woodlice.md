<A title="I STOLEZES THIS FROM DUTCHBINT COS SHE ROX0RZ!!11" HREF="http://www.geocities.com/~gregmck/woodlice/wlicebak.htm">Woodlice</A> are frequently found in clumps or groups. When parts of their bodies touch a surface, woodlice slow down and will eventually stop if enough of their body comes into contact with an object or another woodlouse (thigmokinetic response). This type of behaviour will cause clumping of woodlice as they come into contact with each other as they explore their habitat. This clumping will result in an overall reduction in the surface area to volume ratio of the group (compared with individuals) and this will lead to a reduction in the rate of water loss.
