In the event that I ever have to risk life and limb by driving on Atlanta&#8217;s I-285 during rush hour, I&#8217;ve come up with a new bumpersticker idea. I&#8217;ll buy a [1961 Ford Galaxie][1], paint the parts that aren&#8217;t rusted or covered with [Bondo][2] a deep snot-green, and drive offensively. 

The bumpersticker should read: <A title="First one to come up with this idea, yup." HREF="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&#038;q=%22CHRIST+IS+MY+TURN+SIGNAL%22">&#8220;CHRIST IS MY TURN SIGNAL.&#8221;</A>
