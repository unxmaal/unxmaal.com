One of the few useful features WinXP has that OSX doesn&#8217;t have is &#8220;Hibernate&#8221;. WinXP is able, upon power loss, to save the contents of a sleeping PC&#8217;s RAM to disk, so that the system state and user data isn&#8217;t lost. 

OSX&#8217;s sleep feature drains power, albeit slowly. On my work iBook, it can sleep for just about 3 days with no power, before it goes dead. 

The new Powerbooks have a feature that is called &#8216;Safe Sleep&#8217;, which is pretty much &#8216;Hibernate&#8217;. Since the feature is software-based, it&#8217;s fairly easy to [implement][1] on non-Powerbook Macs.
