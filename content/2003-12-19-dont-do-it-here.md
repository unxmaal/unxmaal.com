According to my referrer stats, someone just came here via a Google search for [&#8220;have to pee&#8221;][1]. 

Look, folks. I know that Google is a great invention and all, but you should know what to do if you have to pee. There&#8217;s no need to perform a quoted query in search engine. 

Just go, already. 

But don&#8217;t do it here.
