I&#8217;ve been using [Flock][1] for a few days, and I&#8217;m really impressed. I&#8217;ve not been a big user of [del.icio.us][2], but I really like the Flock integration. I think my favorite feature so far is the indexed browsing history, which is a real time-saver when doing research.

I&#8217;m posting this using the Flock Blogging toolbar, and it&#8217;s very elegant, and works very well with [WordPress][3]. 

Flock has integrated RSS feeds, but since I use [Bloglines][4] exclusively, I don&#8217;t see much of a point in having my feeds tied to a single browser &#8212; especially since I browse from any of five different computers at any given time.

Some users have complained that Flock is slow or CPU-intensive, but I&#8217;ve not noticed any of those issues so far. The only problem I noticed was that my Mighty Mouse decided to not scroll down, but that could just be me.
