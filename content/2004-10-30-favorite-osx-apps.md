Here&#8217;s a list of my favorite OSX apps.

>   * Web: Safari &#8212; I&#8217;m a Safari fanatic, and really only for its speed and its synced bookmarks.
> 
> 
>   * IM: [Adium][1] &#8212; I&#8217;m a sucker for tabbed interfaces, and this slick, tabbed, multi-protocol chat app is the best around.
> 
> 
>   * [NewsFire][2] &#8212; As I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve read, Newsfire rox my pants. I&#8217;ve tried others, and I still think it&#8217;s the best.
> 
> 
>   * Address Book.app &#8212; this is an indespensible app for me, especially combined with Quicksilver.
> 
> 
>   * Launcher: [Quicksilver][3] &#8212; No other app truly gets to the heart of how _different_ OSX is, and how powerful it can be, than Quicksilver. QS speeds up resource location to a point that the operating system feels almost prescient.

>   * Music Player: iTunes &#8212; At its heart, iTunes is a GUI music player strapped on top of a database. It&#8217;s simple enough that Grandma can use it, but complex enough that I can do nested queries. My one complaint is there is no SQL command window. 
> 
> 
>   * Terminal: [iTerm][4] &#8212; iTerm has sweet, truly transparent terminals, and comes with my beloved tabs.
> 
> 
>   * Calendar: iCal &#8212; iCal is another built-in, indispensable app. I love how it handles multiple calendars, and I&#8217;ve been tinkering with WebDAV to get collaborative published calendars set up for work. 
> 
> 
>   * Keyboard Remover: [OSX2X][5] &#8212; OSX2X lets you control two+ systems with one keyboard, mouse, and monitor. Very handy to have if you use more than one system at once.
> 
> 
>   * Brief Notes: Stickies &#8212; I use Stickie notes constantly for short chunks of reusable codes, config scripts, and so on. If I stop using or needing a note after a while, I&#8217;ll save it and close the Sticky. 
> 
> 
>   * Advanced CD burning app : [Firestarter FX][6] &#8212; The built-in CD burning app, Diskutil, handles some things, but not other. For those, you need this industrial-strength solution. I&#8217;ve only had to use it once, but that&#8217;s because I hate creating dead media, like CDs or DVDs.

>   * Photo Management: iPhoto &#8212; I didn&#8217;t like or use iPhoto until this most recent release. It&#8217;s fast enough now to be useable, and I&#8217;ve come to rely on it for managing my photographic media. After finding a duplicate set of photos from my Savannah vacation for the umpteenth time, I asked myself, &#8220;Why am I not letting this program handle media management for me?&#8221; I dumped every photo I could find into it, added them into &#8216;Smart Albums&#8217;, and haven&#8217;t looked back. And so far, no duplicate images are eating up space on my drives.

>   * Work Email: Entourage &#8212; MS did a good job with Entourage, although it is sometimes pretty slow handling the ginormous amount of email I deal with daily. Still, it&#8217;s a very slick and polished app, incorporating some of the features of MS Project seamlessly into the mail client.
> 
> 
>   * RDC: [MS Remote Desktop Connection][7] = MS makes an excellent RDC client for OSX, so if you need to manage a Terminal Services-enabled client machine from your Mac, get it. It&#8217;s a free download.
> 
> 
>   * Notepad: [SubEthaEdit][8] &#8212; This is Notepad, on steroids. BBEdit always seemed too bulky for what minimal GUI-based text-editing I do [vi], but SEEdit is Just Right. I&#8217;ve not yet been in a situation where I could use its much-touted Rendezvous-enabled features, but I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;re cool. 
> 
> 
>   * News Reader: [Unison][9] &#8212; Unison is a very nice news reader, handling binary aggregation and multi-threaded downloads. 
> 
> 
>   * Movie Player: [VLC][10] &#8212; VLC is the Range Rover of movie players: if you&#8217;ve got a movie file that you can&#8217;t get to play in your standard player, try VLC. It may glitch out in spots, but it&#8217;ll almost always play the file.
