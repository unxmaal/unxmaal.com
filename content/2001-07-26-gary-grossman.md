In 1987, Gary Grossman wrote _<A HREF="http://grace.evergreen.edu/~arunc/brun/sawdust/node15.htm">Instruments, Cybernetics, and Computer</A>_, a short thesis on the correlations between computer-produced music and music produced by analog instruments. This paper is part of a larger body of work pertaining to the [SAWDUST][1] project. SAWDUST was created in the early 1970s, and was one of the first waveform-creating pieces of software.
