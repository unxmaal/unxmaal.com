Wearing a pair of [Levi&#8217;s][1] jeans? Chances are, your zipper is engraved with the letters &#8220;YKK&#8221;, and was manufactured by the <A HREF="http://www.ykkamerica.com/">YKK</A> corporation. The letters YKK stand for the name of the original company: Yoshida Kogyo Kabushikikaisha, founded in 1934.
