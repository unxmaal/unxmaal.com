To prove a point, and also to test the capabilities of my camera, I&#8217;ve made a nice little [note: 4.5mb Quicktime] [movie][1] of a [water-filled][2] geode I picked up at some random tourist trap during one or another vacation in West Texas. Supposedly the water in this geode is millions of years old, although I suppose it could&#8217;ve been inserted via syringe moments before the hawker sold it to me. I prefer to believe I have prehistoric water trapped in a semi-transparent stone sitting on my shelf.

[Nyx][3] thinks the whole idea of the video is creepy, because I&#8217;m &#8220;a thousand miles away and she&#8217;s watching me.&#8221; 

I told her that if she wanted to see something _really_ creepy, I&#8217;d make a little video of exploring my refrigerator. My refrigerator is where food goes to die. It&#8217;s not so much a food storage device as it is a crypt &#8212; a mausoleum of meals past.
