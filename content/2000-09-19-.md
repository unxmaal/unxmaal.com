I love elegant solutions to common problems. I also hate banner ads. 

For a while, I used [Junkbuster][1] to block ads, but it occasionally flaked out on me, and I didn&#8217;t like having the stupid little DOS window floating around either. It never occurred to me that I could just do [this][2]. This is so elegant it makes me all warm and fuzzy inside.
