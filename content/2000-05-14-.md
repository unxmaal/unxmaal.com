_&#8220;We asked about copy protection, and Mr. Herpolsheimer said that they have entirely given up on trying to replicate Sony???s copy protection in bleem!, and one of the deciding factors was when Sony made it apparent during the trial that any attempt by bleem! to implement the PlayStation copy protection and prevent CDRs from being playable, would actually be a direct violation of a Sony patent on their protection scheme.&#8221;_
