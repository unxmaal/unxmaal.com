For some terrible reason, I actually like the [folk remix][1] of Sir Mix-A-Lot&#8217;s &#8220;Baby Got Back&#8221;. 

I&#8217;ve also been diggin&#8217; [Party Ben][2]&#8216;s remixes. In particular, his smashup of Green Day vs. Oasis vs. Travis vs. Aerosmith vs. Eminem, &#8220;[Boulevard of Broken Songs][3]&#8221; is so good, if I hear any of the pre-smashed songs, I think there&#8217;s something wrong with them.
