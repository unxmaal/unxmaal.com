Great news for those of us (me) who have been holding off buying an AMD Athlon-based system until the platform was dual processor-capable: it seems <a href="http://www.valinux.com/" target="_blank">VA Linux</a> yesterday <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/3/17789.html" target="_blank">demoed</a> a machine with dual 900MHz Athlons using the new Palomino core at the ceBIT trade show in Hanover, Germany. More information at tecChannel.de&#8230; Babelfish seems to choke on <a href="http://www.tecchannel.de/news/20010322/thema20010322-3961.html" target="_blank">this URL</a>, but it does an OK translation if you paste the text.
