Yesterday I needed an application that would connect to a router via its serial port. In Windows, I would normally use Hyperterminal. After some research, I discovered Dave Alverson&#8217;s [Zterm][1]. Zterm has been around for a while &#8211;since 1995, as far as I can tell. However, the author has updated the code to be compatible with OSX. Now I can use my iBook to gain dialup out-of-band access to routers. Bwahaha!
