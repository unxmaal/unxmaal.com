OK&#8230; I love my pet.. She&#8217;s a great companion. But I think [this][1] is going WAAAAAY too far. The more disturbing fact is the &#8220;out of stock&#8221; status implying that people have actually bought the out. This speaks well for the average dog owner. This is why I have a cat I guess.
