Okay, **Useless Technology Update.**  
Although I&#8217;m pretty sure no one has it personally, keep an eye out; I need a copy of _&#8220;Suzuka 8 Hours&#8221;_ for the Super Nintendo.

One of my little toys is a SNES Disk Backup/Rom Emulation system, that can do a lot of stuff, but not special chipset rendering.  
So games like Starfox, Super Mario Kart and Pilotwings don&#8217;t work on it. But with a special auxilary card that contains the DSP chipset, it will play them just fine.  
Someone informed me tonight that Suzuka 8 Hours has what amounts to an open-access DSP chipset in it. For all intents and purposes, this supposedly causes it to function like a DSP plugin card. I didn&#8217;t believe the concept at ALL , so I tested it with Super Mario Kart.  
Now, SMK will lock up upon starting a race, when loaded from diskette. But I tried loading it from diskette while I had the game itself in the slot normally reserved for the plugin card (but not accessed in ANY way by the game ROM) and suddenly it worked.. it was a bit glitchy&#8230; but the system was getting minor usage of the DSP chipset in the Super Mario Kart Cartridge&#8230;.

Now, in the unending quest as an 3L33T video game geek, I must procure a Suzuka Cart and test the theory for myself&#8230;

With your help, of course. >;)
