A windows server that a customer handles got exploited and used as an FTP repository for a few hours last week. While driving to Pennsylvania for Thanksgiving, I walked him through applying an access control list (ACL) to his router&#8217;s ethernet port to stop the abusive traffic. He&#8217;s become much more interested in how ACLs work, so today when the topic was mentioned on <A HREF="http://www.nanog.org/">NANOG</A>&#8216;s mailing list, I forwarded this <A HREF="http://www.itprc.com/security.htm">long list of network security links</A> to him. Like most lists of links, some are more useful than others. =]
