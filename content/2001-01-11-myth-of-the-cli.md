[Bill Garrett][1]&#8216;s &#8220;[_Sorcery: The Myth of the Command Line_][2]&#8221; is one of the best articles I can point to as to why I find myself going back to the CLI in _any_ OS I&#8217;m running, when I truly need to get work done. 

I&#8217;ve been on a self- and technology-imposed hiatus from the Linux world for a little over a year now, because I found that I was spending too much time tinkering with my [Debian][3] installation rather than doing something [productive][4]. 

Slowly, however, I&#8217;ve begun to miss the Penguin, and I&#8217;m thinking of spending a few days in intensive reinstallation. 

Case in point: today I needed to make about twenty numbered directories in Windows. I got through the first few [<font size="1">right-click, mouse down, click New, mouse over, click Folder, type in the name of the folder, enter, repeat</font>], when I realized &#8220;Wait, this is STUPID!&#8221; I then popped open a command terminal [<font size="1">type in one string, enter, up-arrow, backspace-and-replace the last digit, repeat</font>] and completed in about thirty seconds what would&#8217;ve taken several minutes using the GUI.
