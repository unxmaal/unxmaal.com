[Gallery][1] is a steaming pile of monkey poop. 

A few months back, I found traces of an attempted hack via Gallery. After doing some investigation, I found that my version had some serious gaping security holes.

Today, I happened to notice that within the last week, my entire Gallery installation had deleted itself (in a fit of existentialism, no doubt). Poof. Gone. There was no longer a directory called gallery/ . 

Luckily, the pictures and albums are stored in a separate directory, so I was able to salvage most things. It&#8217;s a giant pain to have to rebuild the templates and user accounts, though.

I&#8217;d use something else, but I&#8217;d have to figure out how to import it all. That, and I really enjoy bitching about crappy software.
