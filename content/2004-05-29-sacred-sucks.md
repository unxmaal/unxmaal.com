Instead of purchasing [Sacred][1], just bash your computer with a hammer a few times. You&#8217;ll get all the wonderful gameplay, including constant BSODs and random graphics problems, and you&#8217;ll save a boatload of cash. I&#8217;ve had this digitized turd for no more than an hour and it&#8217;s crashed four times. 

Honestly, I&#8217;m really sick of being an unpaid beta-tester for shyster game companies. 

Today I broke two of my own rules: never buy a game unless you&#8217;ve played the demo, or unless the game comes from a company known to make pretty decent products [like Blizzard, id, or the UT folks], and never buy anything from CompUSA. Luckily a quick pre-emptive phone call to the manager at CompUSA will keep me from raining hellfire down upon them when they tried to charge me their 2000% &#8220;restock fee&#8221; or whatever they&#8217;re calling it these days.
