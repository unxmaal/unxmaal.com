<A HREF="http://www.anoto.com/technology/system/">Anoto</A> is developing a map system of digitization on paper: every page printed with the Anoto system of near-invisible dots gets an absolute location on the Anoto grid system. When you write on Anoto-encoded paper with an Anoto-enabled pen, the pen creates a digital trace of what you do, storing the information in the pen until you mark the apropriate section of the page, such as a blank or check-box. The digitized information is then forwarded via Bluetooth to any specified server on the Internet.
