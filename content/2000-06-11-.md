[Melanie][1] wants to be an actor. [Actor? Actress? Is there something wrong with the term &#8220;Actress&#8221;? Did I wake up in a parallel dimension?] 

As much as I loathe Hollywood, I must admit I admire anyone with the stamina to continue trying, day after day, to become gainfully employed in the film industry. 

Good luck, Melle.
