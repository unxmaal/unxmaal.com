I picked up a [EZFlash Advance][1] kit from [MyBayside.com][2], for about $100. I&#8217;ll only be using it to pursue my career in Gameboy game development, of course.

My first USB cable was broken on arrival, but the guy[s] at [MyBayside.com][2] were very responsive and got me a replacement cable within a week. 

The kit includes a USB-to-GBA cable and a 256Mbit flash card, which will store about 4 modern-sized GBA roms. This is a handy way to keep your precious GBA games safe: connect the GBA to your computer via the cable, launch the included client software, and back up your GBA game to a file on your computer. 

Later you can put up to four of these files onto the flash card. This way, if you lose your flash card, you&#8217;re only out $100, instead of $200 if you&#8217;d lost all four games. 

Two other nice features are the ability to back up and restore save games for any game you have saved on the flash card, and the ability to apply cheat codes to games without using an additional piece of hardware.
