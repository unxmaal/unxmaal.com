It&#8217;s official, Netscape sucks. And not just the annoying-periodically sucking, the huge-archnemesis-crappy-browser sucking. And it can officially bite me. Really. I want it to die a slow and horrid death. That would make me feel much better right now. 

Welcome to the sorrows of a web geek. But once I beat Netscape into submission, I&#8217;ll have a cool new design for [**astrogeek.net**][1]. Then all will be good, and life can go on. Until I get pissed off at Netscape again.
