[NOAA][1] sends me email. I should probably never admit this in public. However, my current email from [NOAA][1] tells me that there is a chance of precipitation later tonight. 

I wonder about that term, &#8220;precipitation&#8221;. I know that it means &#8220;stuff falling from the sky.&#8221; What kind of stuff? What if &#8220;precipitation&#8221; meant something other than a random state of water, like&#8230; boats? I&#8217;m not sure my umbrella can handle a light shower of boats. 

I think showers of biscuits would be better. If you were hungry, hey, just reach out and grab a bite to eat!

To me, the worst possible form of precipitation would be headlice. &#8220;Today&#8217;s weather forecast calls for a wintry mix of lice, sleet, and snow.&#8221; I mean, how could you explain that your date? &#8220;Sorry about the nits, hon; I got caught in a bad licestorm on the way over.&#8221;
