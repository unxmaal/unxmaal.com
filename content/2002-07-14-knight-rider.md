Woohoo! [Knight Rider][1] was such a great show &#8230; when I was ten. 

[Doug][2] never got over the coolness of KITT, and even has his cellphone ringtone set to an ultra-loud KR theme song. 

&#8220;Doug, KITT&#8217;s calling you from outside. He says some jerk in a Mercedes clipped your door, and wants you to go kick the guy&#8217;s ass.&#8221;
