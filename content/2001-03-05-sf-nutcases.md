I can guarantee that when I was in school, if the school board had urged us kids to skip school in order to <A HREF="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/03/05/MN41265.DTL">show support for affirmative action</A>, my parents would&#8217;ve joined the thousands of other parents in town and converged upon the school board, bearing semiautomatic weapons with the intent to do harm. 

Frankly, I&#8217;ve got no pity for these slobs. If you cede your child-rearing rights to the government, don&#8217;t complain when the government turns your children into brainwiped automata.
