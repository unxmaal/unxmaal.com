I&#8217;ve only found two comic book viewers &#8212; apps that will display compressed, scanned comic books &#8212; for OSX: 

[CB Viewer][1] and [Jomic][2].

Jomic is large, slow, and Java-based [which you should have guessed from the prior description]. It doesn&#8217;t support gradiated image zoom (that I could find), so you can only view images at either full-size or fit-to-window, which is bad when you&#8217;re trying to read comic books on a smaller laptop screen.

The only reason to get Jomic is because its rival, CB Viewer, hasn&#8217;t seen an update in a few months. I&#8217;m not sure if development has ceased, or the author is just busy. Otherwise, CB Viewer is fast, small, and handles gradiated image zoom quite well.
