Robert: &#8220;I&#8217;m trying to charge the batteries in my camera and it&#8217;s doing something I&#8217;ve never seen it do before.&#8221;

Me: &#8220;Is it making toast?&#8221;

Robert: &#8220;No. It&#8217;s not big enough to make toast.&#8221;

Me: &#8220;It could be making crackers?&#8221;

Robert: &#8220;I didn&#8217;t _ask_ it to make crackers!&#8221;
