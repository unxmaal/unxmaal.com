<A HREF="http://www.spies.com/~aek/orphanage.html">The Minicomputer Orphanage</A> is a repository of information regarding computers built by companies that are no longer in business. 

The site also contains links and references to minicomputer [simulators][1] that you can install and run on modern machines.
