A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, when I first started this site, I had to steal some HTML code. I had no idea how to do anything with webpages, and really still don&#8217;t. While randomly poking around on the web, I found a neat site, and snagged its code. And then promptly forgot the site name. And now, a month later, I find it again. 

[Dratfink][1], I owe it all to you. Even after several complete redesigns, you can still see traces of Dratfink design lingering behind the stage, like a ghostly framework. 

Bah. I&#8217;m waxing melodramatic.
