Woot! [iTerm][1], the best (and yeah, least-frequently-updated) terminal client for OSX has finally been updated!

So far, I really like the new metal skin, and most-importantly, true xterm-like select and middle-click paste.

If you&#8217;re still using OSX&#8217;s built-in terminal.app, give iTerm a try. It&#8217;s free, and it rocks.
