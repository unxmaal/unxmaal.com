I read <A HREF="http://www.jgrisham.com/">John Grisham</A>&#8216;s &#8220;The Summons&#8221; this week. He takes the reader back to Ford County, Mississippi &#8212; recall his first novel, &#8220;A Time to Kill.&#8221; Grisham writes characters in the South so well, without making them all ingrown fools&#8230; which may not seem so profound, particularly if you live here, but this is the first fictional book I&#8217;ve read in a while, so I&#8217;m accustomed to the tired Southern (and other) stereotypes of television.

DirecTV brings in some sharp pictures, but books paint much more vividly. I think I&#8217;ll read more often. Go check out &#8220;The Summons.&#8221;
