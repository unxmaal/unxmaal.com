I really hate nosy people, especially when I&#8217;m at work. 

&#8220;What&#8217;s your last name?&#8221;  
&#8220;It&#8217;s just Eric, from \___, in Atlanta.&#8221;  
&#8220;You don&#8217;t have a last name?&#8221;  
&#8220;No.&#8221;  
&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s strange&#8230;&#8221;  
&#8220;I&#8217;m adopted.&#8221;  
&#8220;..Oh.. I see&#8230;&#8221;  
&#8220;Have a nice day. Goodbye.&#8221;
