Crikey! [Watts][1] has dug up terrible memory from my past: <A HREF="http://lord.doa.org/">Legend Of the Red Dragon</A>. I got into BBSes in &#8217;95, which was pretty much the tail end of the era. I spent most of my time playing this game, and did well, because one of the sysops took pity on my newbie character and gave me about five million gold. 

Weirder still, I met [Jeff][2] and [Kevin][3] while playing, though we didn&#8217;t meet in real life (or realize that we had even met) until some time later.
