Today&#8217;s the second day in a row that I&#8217;ve forgotten to charge the battery on my poor little cell phone. I defend myself by saying I&#8217;m trying to wean it off of electricity. The downside of not having my phone handy is that since my phone stores my phone number list, I have no idea what anyone&#8217;s number is. I guess having these numbers stored in my phone is good, as it means there&#8217;s one less group of facts that I have to remember, but it does suck when I forget to charge the battery. 

As Robert pointed out, maybe phones in the future will keep us from having to remember the names of people we call. 

&#8220;Phone, call ..uhh.. that guy &#8230; that did that thing that time.. and uhh.. who drives that car.. and who&#8230; uhh.. has brown hair.&#8221; Ring. Ring. &#8220;Hey, uhh.. whatever your name is! This is uhh.. well.. whatever my name is! Uhh.. I forgot what I was gonna say. Bye!&#8221;
