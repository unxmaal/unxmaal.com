A common irritation for me, while moving files from one folder to another, is having to stop the move in order to open another Finder window. Springloaded folders help a bit, but not much, and only for immediate transfers. They don&#8217;t help at all for moving files to a folder that hasn&#8217;t been created yet &#8211;&#8220;woops, I forgot to make that folder!&#8221;

That said, [XShelf][1] is freaking awesome. Go get it now.

You may drag individual or multiple files or folders, as well as text clippings and URLs to XShelf. With XShelf, you no longer have to shuffle windows so that both the source and target of a drag and drop are onscreen at the same time.&#8221;

I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s anything like this for Windows, but there needs to be. Having to keep multiple file-manager windows open sucks.
