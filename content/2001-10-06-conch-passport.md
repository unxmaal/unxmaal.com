According to <A HREF="http://english.pravda.ru/main/2001/10/06/17232.html">Pravda</A>, terrorist <http://ca.news.yahoo.com/010913/5/aci6.html>Mohammed Atta</a> carried a passport from the unrecognized [Republic of Conch][1].

Here&#8217;s a few notes:  
If you&#8217;re here looking for Conch passports, you must understand that you are intrinsically a **fucking moron**. I have no passports for you. I have no idea how to get them or why in fuck&#8217;s sake you&#8217;d want one. I could truly care less. 

Since you&#8217;re a **fucking moron**, let me be clear:  


<center>
  </blink>THERE ARE NO FUCKING CONCH PASSPORTS HERE. DO NOT FUCKING ASK FOR ANY INFORMATION REGARDING THE FUCKING CONCH FUCKING PASS FUCKING PORTS HERE. IN FACT, GO FUCKING CLOSE YOUR FUCKING BROWSER, YOU PIGFUCKING ASS EATERS, BECAUSE YOU ARE TOO FUCKING STUPID TO USE A FUCKING COMPUTER.
</center></blink>.

Does my point get across? 

I thought not. 

I&#8217;ve closed comments on this post. 

Fuck off.
