Because Laura is special, she scored some sneak preview passes to [Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban][1].

**Not really spoilers, but just in case.**

I&#8217;ve read all the books, so it&#8217;s hard to review a single movie that is already two books behind. 

At over two hours, this installment seems pretty long. It&#8217;s also much darker than the last two HP movies. The pace of the film seems slower, and less time is spent on reinforcing the &#8216;prettiness&#8217; and &#8216;perfection&#8217; of the Witches&#8217; world. It seems that as Harry and his friends grow older, the dangers of their world are becoming more apparent. 

The movie was pretty faithful to the book, only skipping character-building sections devoted to minor characters, such as the Weasley twins and Professor Trelawny

I do wonder how the director will handle the actors&#8217; changing appearances as they age. The kids are supposed to be thirteen, and they look about sixteen now. By the time the sixth movie comes out, they&#8217;ll have grey hair. 

If you&#8217;ve not read the book, you&#8217;ll probably find it more suspenseful than I did. In all, it&#8217;s a fun movie, well worth the cash you&#8217;ll spend to see it, and will undoubtably be _the_ summer kids&#8217; movie blockbuster.
