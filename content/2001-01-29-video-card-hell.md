For the last few days, I&#8217;ve been trapped in Video Card Hell. 

I decided on Friday that I really _needed_ a better video card, so I bought an <A HREF="http://www.asus.com/products/Addon/Vga/agpv7700d/index.html">ASUS AGP-V7700 GeForce2 GTS Deluxe</A>. When I installed it, I immediately started having problems: the BIOS display was filled with weird blinking white dots, and Win2k would crash before it got past the loading screen. After lots of testing, I found that the card would do this regardless of which computer I put it in, so the only thing I could think of was a corrupted BIOS on the card itself. 

Saturday, I took the card back to Alabama Computer Associates, and they happily swapped it for another card. This card installed easily enough, but within two minutes of playing [Unreal Tournament][1], the whole machine would freeze. So, again, more testing. And more testing. 

Almost to the point of taking the second card back, I found an interesting thread on [AMDMB.com][2]. Apparently there is a known bug with Win2k and the VIA chipset, so I applied the patch, and afterwards was able to play UT and other games with no problems. I&#8217;m still having an occasional crash, but according to [this thread][3], it could be a ram issue. I have no idea whether my current ram is AMD-compatible, but it&#8217;s next on the list for replacement.
