Given the steady pace of advancements in medical technology, suppose that at some point in the future, deaths due to old age and illness was no longer common, if even possible.

Suppose that technology was then applied to pets. This seems reasonable to me, since people love their pets. Also, a lot of times medicines are tested on animals before humans, so the treatments might be easier to apply to pets.

I wonder, how smart could a dog or a cat get after it had lived for 100 years or more?

Our pets could be &#8216;upgraded&#8217; to perform roles their physiology could never have handled in the past. Imagine having a dog that also acts as a trusted, intelligent advisor, that has been genetically engineered to act as both pet and PDA. Forget your PC, how about the new iDog?
