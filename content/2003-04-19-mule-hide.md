Tonight Laura and I were at Ruby Tuesday&#8217;s, and I saw this sign on the wall.  
It was one of those old ads that some designer bought for fifty cents at a flea-market and sold to the restaurant chain for $500.

It was for &#8220;Mule-Hide&#8221;.

I immediately thought of some type of cream for a mule.

You know, to hide it. 

&#8220;I say, Jim, that mule of yours is pretty darn conspicuous! You need some MULE-HIDE!!&#8221; 

Then I went on to think that maybe it was for some terrible skin condition

&#8220;Sorry, Jane, but Betty can&#8217;t go out tonight. She&#8217;s got **mules** all over her nose.&#8221;

&#8220;Well, Mary, she should try the new Extra Strength MULE HIDE!!&#8221;
