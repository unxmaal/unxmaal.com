Last night, geeks congregated at my place to eat meat.

Laura made the world&#8217;s best salsa. Finally, after much coercing, Daniel, Dori, Chris, James, and Robert showed up. 

The result was to be expected: James repeatedly shot himself in the toe, Robert tried to play with James&#8217; gun, and there was a general argument over whether IPX/SPX sucks more than TCP/IP.

The only casualty was an unfortunate [and very ugly] insect.
