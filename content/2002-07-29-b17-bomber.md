&#8220;Back in the Day&#8221;, I remember playing countless hours&#8217; worth of [B17 Bomber][1] on my old handed-down Intellivision. I was never very good at the game, and since I&#8217;d lost all the little plastic inserts for the horrid Intellivision controller, I only had a vague idea of what the controls were. In the end, I had much more fun distorting the in-game voices by half-unplugging the &#8216;voice-synthesis&#8217; module.
