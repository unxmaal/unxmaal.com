For a few months Robert and I have debated deleting these two obscure and indefineable albums. 

&#8220;What the hell is _this_ bleepy crap?&#8221; I exclaim, and move on to something else. 

A few weeks pass, and Robert might attempt to listen, before giving up in disgust. 

&#8220;It sounds like medical equipment malfunctioning.&#8221; 

&#8220;More like &#8216;Revenge of the EMS Tone&#8217;.&#8221; 

Yesterday, Robert finally decided to do some investigation to find out exactly what Ryoji Ikeda&#8217;s _[::Matrix: Music for Rooms][1]_ was really about. 

&#8220;Wow!&#8221; He played one of the tracks, and moved around the room. &#8220;Dude! Move around!&#8221; I did, and noticed the change in tone. 

Ikeda&#8217;s ::Matrix is an extremely minimalistic work of sonic sculpture, designed to be played in a large room, and most importantly, listened to while _[moving][2]_. The effect is truly &#8230; interesting, and more than a little unnerving.
