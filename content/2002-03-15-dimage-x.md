To replace my aging Kodak DC-something digital camera [that only had a serial connector, ick], I got a tiny new Minolta DiMage X today. So far, it&#8217;s pretty nice. Considering the batteries are still charging and I haven&#8217;t taken any pictures with it yet. Here is a very [concise][1] review of the DiMage X.

Is it me, or should Minolta have fired the person who came up with the name &#8220;Dimage&#8221; for a camera?
