Somewhere in the twisted mental pathways that make up the tiny brain of my little dog, [Tak][1], the phrase &#8220;It&#8217;s a trap!&#8221; &#8212; said in an [Admiral Ackbar][2] voice &#8212; means &#8220;there is a squirrel outside. Go find and kill it now!&#8221;

Really.

&#8220;It&#8217;s a trap!&#8221;

And the dog bolts out of the room, off the porch, and over to the nearest tree, hell-bent for some squealy squirrel death.
