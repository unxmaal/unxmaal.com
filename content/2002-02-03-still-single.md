Said to a sleeper, online: &#8220;_maybe you&#8217;ve always been able to get away with discounting the opinions of others, but I will not accept it. I don&#8217;t know you, and honestly, I don&#8217;t care to. You&#8217;re quite honestly the most vacant and uninteresting person I have ever met online. I really don&#8217;t know why you continue talking to me. If you see me online, please, just block me, rather than attempting contact._&#8221;

I&#8217;m thinking I&#8217;m still single because I never learned tolerance. How far backwards must I bend just to get a lousy date with someone I find insipid? With someone who doesn&#8217;t like robots, or Legos, someone who can&#8217;t see the inherent beauty in the world, some sleeper who will never awaken? 

Mercifully, I&#8217;m twenty-seven. Maybe next year I&#8217;ll be desperate enough to weather through inane conversations about pop stars and fast cars and did you see the pants _she_ was wearing. The year after, I can &#8220;settle&#8221; for a shaggy bison who eats her own weight in bacon while gossipping about imaginary characters on soap opera television. This is what it means to be alone in the twenty-first century. 

No. If this is my future, one of servitude to my own fear, fear of solitude, then I reject it. 

To you, my greasy, fumbling, floppy-hipped and heart-conditioned future wife: let us never meet. Stay on your couch, watch your soaps, and I&#8217;ll find the courage in myself to avoid meeting you. Maybe in waiting I&#8217;ll be able to find that nice girl who groks computers and archaeology and deep magic. Better late than never.
