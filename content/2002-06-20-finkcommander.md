Recipe for easy use and management of Open-Source Unix apps on OSX:



1. Download and install the Apple Developer Kit. It&#8217;s a pretty hefty install at around 500MB, but you&#8217;ll need it for the Darwin C compiler, cc. 

2. Download and install [X11][1] for OSX.

3. Download and install the [OroborOSX][2] window manager.

4. Download and installFink<a>. </p> 

<p>
  5. Finally, download and install <A href="http://finkcommander.sourceforge.net/">FinkCommander</a>.
</p>

<p>
  FinkCommander is an excellent, indispensible GUI interface for the command-line Fink package manager. It allows you to update your installed Unix packages at the touch of a button, and to search for new packages by name or by keyword. 
</p>

<p>
  If you&#8217;re interested in what Open Source has to offer, this is an excellent way to dive in.
