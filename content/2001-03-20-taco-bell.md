[Taco Bell][1], the staple of my college days, has set up a 40&#215;40 foot target in the Pacific Ocean in preparation for Mir&#8217;s reentry. If, by some extraordinary stroke of luck, the core of Mir strikes the target, Taco Bell will give every American a <A HREF="http://www.tacobell.com/3company/2business/mir.htm">free taco</A>.

Taco Bell has insured the floating target against satellite hits in order to cover the cost of the free taco redemption &#8230; just in case.
