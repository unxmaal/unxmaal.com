Christina and I were driving somewhere this weekend, and she saw a bumpersticker on the car in front of us. 

&#8220;What&#8217;s a F-mumble-mumble?&#8221;  
&#8220;Huh?&#8221;  
&#8220;What&#8217;s a Foowazeemumble?&#8221;  
&#8220;I still didn&#8217;t hear you.&#8221;  
&#8220;That car in front of us &#8212; the sticker! What&#8217;s a Fugazi?&#8221;

Now I think to myself, &#8220;How can anyone NOT know who [Fugazi][1] is? They&#8217;re only one of the most famous anti-corporate Straight-Edge bands on the planet!&#8221;

I can tell it&#8217;s time for Christina&#8217;s education to begin.
