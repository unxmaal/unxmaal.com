Last night some cock-nozzle from the [Home Warranty Scam][1] company called. 

&#8220;Hi, I&#8217;m Bob with [Home Buyer&#8217;s Warranties][2]!!! I just wanted to let you know that your home warranty coverage ends at the end of this month.&#8221; 

&#8220;Oh, EXCELLENT!&#8221; 

&#8220;Uh.. well I was calling to see if you wanted to renew it?&#8221; 

&#8220;Absolutely not. I&#8217;d rather be mauled by wild dogs.&#8221; 

&#8220;&#8230; Er..&#8221; 

&#8220;MAULED. By DOGS. As in.. EATEN.&#8221; 

&#8220;So you weren&#8217;t happy with the service?&#8221; 

&#8220;I was exhilarated. Don&#8217;t ever call me again.&#8221; Click.
