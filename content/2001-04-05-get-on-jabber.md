It&#8217;s bad enough that AIM has been utterly unreliable this week, but what most of you probably don&#8217;t know is the likely reason for the brokenness. AOL is trying to kill interoperability of other messaging systems with AIM. So far <a href="http://gaim.sourceforge.net/index.shtml" target="_blank">GAIM</a> and Jabber have occasionally been able to work around the restrictions, but AOL keeps moving the targets. I strongly suspect that in so doing they have broken their own official clients. If they&#8217;re going to play that way, I don&#8217;t want to play with them. Unx suggested getting on MSN Messenger; I have a better suggestion that&#8217;s not run by an evil empire: go register with <a href="http://www.jabber.com/" target="_blank">Jabber</a>. It&#8217;s open, free, and interoperates with Yahoo, MSN, ICQ, and (sometimes) AIM if you have accounts on those systems.
