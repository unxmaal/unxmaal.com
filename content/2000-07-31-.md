Ahh, more updates: As some of you have noticed, I&#8217;ve gotten rid of nasty underlines in the link boxes. I&#8217;ve also created an easy way to get to Archives, over on the left side. Also, I&#8217;ve noticed that this page looks like absolute crap in Netscape 4.x . For those *NIX users, I suggest downloading [Opera][1] or [Mozilla][2]. You get what you pay for.
