I can&#8217;t read. I especially can&#8217;t read instructions. On Smalltime&#8217;s [Dictator][1] site, you&#8217;re supposed to pretend that you&#8217;re either a dictator, or an actor from some TV sitcom. The site then asks you questions, such as &#8220;Are you male or female?&#8221; And so on. 

I didn&#8217;t read the instructions. I thought the site was asking questions about _me_. I got all the way through the questionnaire, and it guessed that I was Fred Savage, from _Working_. When I told it no, the site demanded that I explain who I was, so I filled in the form. Now, I guess I&#8217;m either a dictator, or a sitcom actor.
