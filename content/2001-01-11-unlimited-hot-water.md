One thing I really hate is running out of hot water when I shower. This topic came up in discussion a few weeks ago with Rod and ubergenius [Alan Booker][1], and Alan suggested I look into inline water heaters. The idea behind inline water heaters is that since you only use hot water at a few places, there is no need to have a huge tank heating water all the time. With an inline heater, you add multiple units where they are needed (kitchen and bathroom), and they turn on when you turn on the faucet. The best part: this means you get unlimited hot water (or until your electricity runs out). 

Here&#8217;s some links to the heaters I&#8217;ve found:

>   * [Acutemp Electric Tankless][2]&#8212; $600 
>       * [HotShot][3]&#8212; none listed 
>           * The [Controlled Energy][4] product line &#8211;varies </blockquote>
