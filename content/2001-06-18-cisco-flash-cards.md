Has anyone ever successfully gotten a <A HREF="http://www.rdrop.com/~cary/html/pc_card_faq.html#software_setup">Flash PC Card</A> (like from a Cisco router) to work in a laptop PCMCIA slot? 

I know this has to work somehow. It seems to me that this would be a great intermediary step between floppies and CDRoms, as the Flash Cards hold up to 128MB and supposedly act like removable drives.
