My sister says this is a true story about me, when I was a little kid:

&#8220;Dad ran into a lady the other day who taught Bible School one summer. She said she would never forget you, because, at the end of the School, when they asked who would like to lead the prayer, you volunteered. 

&#8220;You said, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to say the kittycat prayer: &#8216;Meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow. Amen.'&#8221; 

&#8220;Of course all the kids had to say their own animal noise prayer &#8212; it was a disaster.&#8221;
