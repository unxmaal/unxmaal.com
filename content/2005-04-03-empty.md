I come home from a walk at 6:30AM because what else are you going to do at 6:30AM on a Sunday when you can&#8217;t sleep. 

Home. Yesterday, for about half the day, I had a home. I had a dog and a cat and a girlfriend whom I thought was the best person in the world. 

Now I don&#8217;t have the girl or the dog or the cat, and I have a house, an empty one, not a home.

I feel like I&#8217;ve been robbed. Thieves came in when I was at lunch with my parents, and stole my life, and replaced it with cardboard boxes.

Boxes. I need those, if you guys have any. I have some, but a home doesn&#8217;t fit into &#8216;some&#8217; boxes. 

I&#8217;m off to get more boxes, and groceries, and a recipe book or two. I&#8217;ll be damned if I&#8217;ll go back to eating at restaurants every night.
