After years(!) of drooling, I ordered a [MINI Cooper S][1] from [Global Imports][2]. _I would&#8217;ve gone to Hank Aaron Mini, but the sales weasels tried to rob me. Luckily, I know Excel and wouldn&#8217;t put up with them trying to charge interest on the total amount, without counting the down payment._

It&#8217;s Chili Red with black stripes, roof, and mirrors, similar to [this one][3]. It should arrive sometime in May.
