An [Aerogel][1] is a super-porous silicon-based substance that is over 99.8% air. Aerogels are currently being used by NASA to catch micrometeorites, as well as for insulation. 

Since aerogels can possibly (rarely) occur in nature, there has been some [speculation][2] that there are aerogel-based organisms living in the higher reaches of Earth&#8217;s atmosphere. These organisms would be almost invisible, nearly weightless, and would almost never reach the surface without dissolving.
