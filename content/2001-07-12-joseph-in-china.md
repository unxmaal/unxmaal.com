Joseph is vacationing in China for two weeks or so. The hotel prices have shocked him.

_Joseph_: Dammit, I just paid 20 bucks for 2 cans of Diet Coke!  
_Me_: Really?!  
_Joseph_: And 370 dollars for lunch!! Do NOT eat at your hotel here.  
_Me_: Man, I had one of those &#8220;YOU WIN A FREE 20OZ BOTTLE OF COKE&#8221; bottlecaps I could&#8217;ve sent you.  
_Joseph_: It&#8217;s screwed. I can buy a clone [Palm V][1] for 25$, or get two cans of Diet Coke. WTF?
