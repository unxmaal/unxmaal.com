These [smart dust][1] devices bear curious resemblance to devices discussed in Vernor Vinge&#8217;s novel, [_A Deepness In The Sky_][2].

In &#8220;Deepness&#8221;, these devices are known as &#8220;localizers&#8221;, and with their limited distributed computation, surveillance, and movement abilities, they prove to be a cornerstone of space-faring civilization. With a cloud of localizers in a microgravity environment, construction becomes a matter of simplicity, as a single person can easily manage many independent objects at once. For more info, go buy the book. I liked it.
