I&#8217;ve been using a Fedora workstation in conjuction with my iBook at work, and I&#8217;ve gotten used to the handy &#8216;lock screen&#8217; button on the Gnome toolbar. 

I wanted the same type of &#8216;lock screen&#8217; button for OSX, but didn&#8217;t know of any quick and easy way to enable it. I did some research, and came up with this nice [but oddly hidden] method:

Keychain Access is used to store passwords to web sites, network servers, and lockable volumes. However, it also provides a quick way of securing your computer. 

Open Applications > Utilities > Keychain Access. Click View > &#8220;Show Status in Menu Bar&#8221; to display a menu marked by an icon of a padlock at the right hand end of the menu bar at the top of your screen. Choosing &#8220;Lock Screen&#8221; from this menu will start the screen saver, and will prompt for a password for further access.
