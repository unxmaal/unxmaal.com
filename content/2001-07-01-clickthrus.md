Yay! It&#8217;s the first day of a new month, so it&#8217;s time to see which person spent too much time clicking his own link! The winner for the month of June, with 115 clickthroughs, is [Matt Rossi][1]!!

I&#8217;ve spoken with Matt about his recent victory, and he said that it was achieved through the creative use of aardvarks, Perl scripts, and tequila. Way to go, Matt!

I highly recommend reading Matt&#8217;s [page][1]. It&#8217;ll melt your head!
