Last Thursday, Heather and I went to the [Fox Theatre][1] to see &#8220;The Phantom of the Opera&#8221;. I&#8217;d never been to the Fox, and was very impressed. The theater is gorgeously designed with a Arabian theme, and inside the theater itself, the seating and stage is under a sky-blue ceiling that gives the impression of being in a Arabian mosque near sunset &#8212; complete with twinkling stars. 

&#8220;Phantom&#8221; was also quite good; I&#8217;m not a big fan of musicals, but the show was very engaging, and the stagecraft was excellent. I highly recommend seeing it; it&#8217;s definitely an experience worth having.
