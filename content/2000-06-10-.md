Well, this is something else that no one but me will care about or appreciate, so I figured I&#8217;d blog it too.

I Absolutely adore cheap, knock-off toys, especially robots and the ilk&#8230;. As is evidenced by my collection of robots, which number quite a few, due mostly to the ready availablility of Cool Spawn and Gundam robots, my robot addiction + Ebay, and due in part to the plentiful nature of cheap gundam etc knock-offs at places like &#8220;Big Lots&#8221; and &#8220;Dollar General&#8221; stores.  
When my friends Hannah and Brad recently went to the UK for their Honeymoon, they were nice enough to bring me back some wonderful little items, which only someone such as myself and The Maroneys can truly appreciate.

They got me this blister-carded set of toys, called &#8220;Space Combat,&#8221; which just goes to prove that no matter what country you&#8217;re in, Taiwan still makes the best cheapo ripoff toys. This set happened to be an Uber-blatant Star Wars ripoff. And before I go on, let me stress to you, that this was all **IN ONE SET.** So no matter how out-of-place it seems, these items are supposed to be here.  
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.shadowstitch.com/dartboard.jpg">This thing</a> must be some kind of Jedi Dartboard or something. I don&#8217;t know. The thing above it is a transparent suction cupped throwing dart. The dartboard itself strikes me as a cheap rendition of the falcon and two wannabe x-wing fighters. But maybe I&#8217;m on crack.  
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.shadowstitch.com/pinkship.jpg">This thing</a> is some kind of pink-winged space ship. I don&#8217;t understand why it was included, since it&#8217;s horribly out of scale with anything and everything else in the package.  
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.shadowstitch.com/r2dwhat.jpg">This guy</a> must be some kind of R2D2 clone. I mean, what else has that physiognomy?  
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.shadowstitch.com/falseblarth.jpg">This guy</a> seems to be my favorite item here. it&#8217;s a strange figurine wearing black armor and a conspicuously lame multicolored cardboard Tank Top. He bears an uncanny resemblance to another star wars character, <font size="1">(you guess who)</font> with all the fashion sense of a hawaiian tourist. HOWEVER&#8230;. arm him with one of the guns he came with, or with, say, a badly designed little short sword <font size="1">(that may or may not be a energy beam, due to the 1-color plastic molding, we will never truly know.)</font> and remove the tank top, and provide him with a black cape from some other figure <font size="1">(who shall remain nameless)</font> and you get something akin to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.shadowstitch.com/blarth.jpg">this&#8230;.</a> Resembles someone, doesn&#8217;t it?  
But by far the most NonSequitur item in the package was <a target="_blank" href="http://www.shadowstitch.com/darthpager.jpg">this item.</a> Now maybe it&#8217;s just me, but I don&#8217;t see what a cheap blue plastic Pager has to do with anything in this package. Maybe it&#8217;s so the boy or girl can pretend he or she is getting a page from Blarth Spader <font size="1">(as we affectionately call him)</font> and must hurry to his or her tiny pink spaceship in order to ..I dunno..do something that requires a suction cup dart. I give up on this one.

The other item is a trio of **ROBOTS** that Brad was hard-fought to acquire in Jolly old England. apparently robots are scarce in that country; yet another reason I&#8217;m proud I live in a country where anyone can purchase robots or download the gummi bears theme any time of the day or the night.  
He apparently had quite an argument with the shopkeeper over the nature of the toys. The shopkeeper insisted they were Aliens, and Brad insisted that while they may in fact be from another world, they are, first and foremost, Robots.  
According to the picture <a target="_blank" href="http://www.shadowstitch.com/robots.jpg">here,</a> They are most definitely robots, although as Brad explains it, &#8220;The first one is some kind of robotic space angel, the second one MIGHT be a cyborg, but is more than likely just a robot with organic stylings, and the third one is MOST DEFINITELY a humanoid-shaped robot.&#8221; I am inclined to agree on all three counts.

<font size="1">Once again, <b>I</b> thought it was neat. If you don&#8217;t&#8230;. Something is wrong with you. Seek help.</font>
