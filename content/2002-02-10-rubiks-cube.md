I prefer simple solutions to problems. True, some attempts at solving a problem may appear to be &#8220;simple solutions&#8221;, when they actually cause more problems than they solve. Solution complexity appears to scale with the complexity of the problem. 

I learned this maxim at an early age. I got my first Rubik&#8217;s Cube when I was eight. I immediately mixed it up, thinking I could solve the problem. Unfortunately, I had no interest in mathematics, and very little patience. I promptly tossed the scrambled cube into the toy box and forgot about it for a few years. When I rediscovered it, I had this genius idea: I could pry the pieces of the cube apart, and reassemble the cube in the correct order. Given a screwdriver and five minutes, and I had a properly-arranged Rubik&#8217;s Cube. Sure, I didn&#8217;t solve the problem according to the guidelines listed on the box, but at age nine, I could care less about the methods of my solution. 

While I still consider the screwdriver solution to be very good, the [self-solving Lego robot solution][1] is pretty darn elegant.
