Imagine this:  
You&#8217;re fifteen, and you&#8217;ve just been expelled from high school [for casting a spell][1]. 

The sheer stupidity of the school and administrators aside, would that not just _rock_? I mean, nobody would _dare_ mess with you again! Ever! 

&#8220;Oh, you don&#8217;t want to vote for me for Class President? Well, that&#8217;s ok. I hope that little acne problem of yours doesn&#8217;t get &#8230; worse&#8230;&#8221;
