[Apple][1]s are as organic as the name implies. Devices that plug into the main machine often have additional connector ports, which in turn serve to connect other devices. A camera plugs into a keyboard that is home to a mouse, and the keyboard connects to the G4 tower. Rather than the monolithic PC tower, where adding a peripheral requires turning off the system, removing panels, and socketing new cards, the Apple peripherals and systems sprout and sprawl like living things across and through the desktop. The [iPod][2], covered in its semitransparent [plastic cover][3], slurps electricity from a cable connected to an external hard drive, itself connected to the G4.
