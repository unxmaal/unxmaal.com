Sorry for the downtime, folks &#8212; yesterday I rebuilt the box that serves unxmaal.com, and this morning I put <A HREF="http://www.php.net/">php</A>+<A HREF="http://www.mysql.com/">mysql</A> support back into <A HREF="http://httpd.apache.org/">apache</A>. Mailservice is still on its way back, so hold off on the &#8220;we missed you, unx&#8221; and &#8220;how&#8217;s atlanta, unx?&#8221; and &#8220;let&#8217;s spawn monkeys, unx&#8221; emails for now. This is the first time in <A HREF="http://uptime.netcraft.com/up/today/top.avg.html">over 368 days</A> this server has been rebooted, so whining will only conjure the <A HREF="http://www-personal.umd.umich.edu/~nhughes/bofh/">bofh</A>.

We now return to your regularly scheduled mindbending; have a nice day!
