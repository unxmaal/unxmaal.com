While speaking with the exterminator today, I picked up a nice bit of trivia: Vitamin K is an antidote to [Warfarin][1] &#8212; aka &#8220;rat poison&#8221;. 

The exterminator asked if there was dog food left out where the rats could get to it. He explained that dog food contains vitamin K, which would neutralize any rat poison he left out.
