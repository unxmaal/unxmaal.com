I&#8217;m sorry, I have a one track mind when it comes to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.workingdesigns.com">Working Designs</a> and their <a target="_blank" href="http://www.scifi.com/swamp/">Anton Arcane-like</a> perversions of perfectly wonderful video games.  
I&#8217;ve played about 45 minutes of a game called <a target="_blank" href="http://psx.ign.com/reviews/14330.html">&#8220;Vanguard Bandits,&#8221;</a> today. It is a competent, if dated, Strategy game, involving  
giant robots in a fantasy type setting. Lame when compared to say, <a target="_blank" href="http://psx.ign.com/reviews/12913.html">Front Mission 3, </a>but it could have been so much more.

I will admit, I chuckled when I killed an Enemy &#8220;ATAC&#8221; and they shouted, &#8220;Calgon, take me away!&#8221; or when my character shouted an attack;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.austinpowers.com">&#8220;Judo CHOP!&#8221;</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.castlegate.net/personals/kdavis/gwninfo.html">&#8220;Take off, you hoser, Eh.&#8221;</a>&#8230;

Of course, I chuckled at least the first few times they said it.  
After the fifth time, and after being slapped in the face with such anachronisms as a gnarled old crone pilot speaking on the same manner as <a target="_blank" href="http://www.campbell161.freeserve.co.uk/yoda.htm">Yoda,</a> and shouting gleefully &#8220;Filled my &#8216;Depends&#8217; with joy I have!&#8221; I had the suspension of disbelief that would normally cause me to adore a &#8220;Final Fantasy Tactics meets Front Mission&#8221; Strategy game, ripped from my mind and forcibly shat upon.  
Do Working Designs REALLY think they&#8217;re being &#8220;cute&#8221; by ruining games this way? Apparently so. And that&#8217;s also why you&#8217;ll find their games in the 10$ bargain bin. Fair-weather gamers will play their releases for a few days, then forget about their lackluster performance; a lot like watching comedians from the 80&#8217;s. And the hardcore gamers are so disgusted by the tripe they&#8217;re being fed that they know not to go near WD games to begin with.  
 <font size="1">Don&#8217;t even get me STARTED on how the cruddy, dated opening animation was accompanied by, you guess it, a LAME-ASS song, sung by the same singer who has done &#8220;Luna&#8221; and &#8220;Every other WD singing female&#8217;s&#8221; voice since 1992.</font>  
And to top the whole distasteful excrement confection all off, The game was originally called &#8220;Detonator Gauntlet,&#8221; But WD changed the name to &#8220;Vanguard Bandits&#8221; (an equally nonsensical and stupid name) after being pressured by Midway, makers of &#8220;Gauntlet&#8221; and &#8220;Gauntlet Legends.&#8221; Now more than ever, I believe WD are not only stupid, they&#8217;re PANSIES.
