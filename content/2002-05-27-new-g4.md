This weekend I bought an [Apple Macintosh Server G4/500][1] from [Rod][2]. It is much love. 

The machine came with a 500 MHz PowerPC 7400 (G4) processor with the AltiVec &#8220;Velocity Engine&#8221; vector processing unit and 1 MB of backside cache, 340 MB of RAM, three 18.0 Ultra2 LVD SCSI hard drives, an ATI Rage 128 Pro, and a SCSI DVD-Rom drive. I added another 256 MB of Ram, and will eventually fill the system to capacity with 1.5GB of RAM. As soon as I figure out how to remove the front bezel, I&#8217;m going to replace the DVD drive with my 16x Yamaha burner. 

Photos: [Side][3]; [Front][4]; [Inside][5]; [Inside Again][6]. 

I don&#8217;t have a name for it yet. Any suggestions?
