Mariah Carey: &#8220;<A HREF="http://www.whatever-dude.com/posts/66.shtml">her face looks like a puppy that&#8217;s been stretched and beaten</A>&#8220;.

I can state that I&#8217;ve never liked Mariah Carey&#8217;s porpoise-like wailings. I hate the entire genre of pop-soul-female-vocalist music. [Or maybe I just hate pop]. I&#8217;ve always had an implicit understanding that there was no real Mariah Carey, as there is no real Michael/Janet Jackson, or a real Britney Spears. All of these entities are as real as the characters from Dragonball Z, perhaps even less so. These pop stars are packaged commodities, designed by engineering firms and mass-produced in Wisconsin factories, prepped, lacquered, and breast-implanted for public consumption. 

If you don&#8217;t know of anything better to listen to, you&#8217;ll listen to Mariah.
