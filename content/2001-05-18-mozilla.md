I&#8217;m hoping that I won&#8217;t be as disappointed in [Mozilla][1] 0.9 as I was in all of the prior releases. So far everything seems to be working pretty well. My favorite feature thus far is being able to click the middle mouse button to open a link in a new window. This is a carryover from using [Netscape][2] in [Linux][3], and it always irked me that middle-button window-opening didn&#8217;t work in the Windows browsers. 

Stranger still is how I&#8217;ve switched from using the colossally outdated Netscape 4.x on my [Sun][4] Ultra 10 workstation to using [Internet Explorer for Unix][5].
