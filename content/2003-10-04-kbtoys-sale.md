Woohoo! KBToys got sued &#8211;and [lost][1]&#8212; regarding some unsavory sales tactics. 

The punishment? They have to hold a &#8220;30% off&#8221; sale on October 8-14. Note that the sale is unadvertised and the sales clerks won&#8217;t say anything about it, although there may be signs posted in the stores.

I think I&#8217;ll be doing some early holiday shopping&#8230;
