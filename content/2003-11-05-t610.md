After a brief stint with the Stabbing Pain That Is Nextel, I upgraded my trusty old Nokia 8290 phone to a shiny new [Sony Ericsson T610][1]. 

I love this phone. It&#8217;s truly a revolutionary leap beyond the old Nokia, acting as a PDA, a camera, and a voice-note recorder, as well being a pretty good phone. 

I picked up a Belkin Bluetooth adapter for about $40, which drastically improves the usefulness of the phone. Using [iSync][2], I&#8217;ve now got a standard set of contacts, calendars, and memos, between all my Macs, my .Mac account, my iPod, and my phone. 

Bluetooth connectivity, paired with the [Salling Clicker][3], allows me to use my phone as an integrated remote control for all manner of Mac OSX apps. So far I&#8217;ve tested it as a very handy remote control for [iTunes][4], and as a DVD remote. 

Salling Clicker is fairly smart, too: if I&#8217;m listening to iTunes, and I get a call, SC can pause iTunes, set iChat to be &#8220;away&#8221;, display the caller&#8217;s information and picture on the Mac&#8217;s screen, and answer the phone. I can also very easily move files between Mac and phone, which makes transferring ringtones, wallpapers, camera photos, and themes very easy. 

Another nice feature of SC is &#8216;proximity-based actions&#8217;. If I&#8217;m listening to iTunes, and go out of Bluetooth range, SC will pause iTunes for me, until I get back within range. 

[James][5], (and anyone else who&#8217;s interested), go to [MyT610.net][6] for lots of free wallpapers, themes, and so on.
