This [review][1] of X3 had an interesting note about one of the best scenes of the movie: 

> In one scene, the unstoppable Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones) bashes through wall after wall, until a naive Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page) slows him down by sinking him into the floor. The angry mutant declares, &#8220;I&#8217;m the Juggernaut, bitch!&#8221; and then continues on his quest, but the brief line sticks out glaringly in an otherwise vulgarity-free film. &#8220;When that line comes up, I&#8217;m probably going to start breakdancing, and Randy will scream out the phrase himself,&#8221; 21-year-old college student Xavier Nazario said excitedly, thrilled over the prospect of watching Jones utter the line made popular by an Internet spoof Nazario released last February. Using an old &#8220;X-Men&#8221; cartoon, Nazario and pal Randy Hayes dubbed their voices in, giving birth to the now-famous catchphrase. Hayes, who voiced Juggernaut&#8217;s ghetto persona in the top-rated [YouTube.com clip][2], isn&#8217;t quite so shocked that Ratner paid tribute to the clip. &#8220;Everybody loves the Juggernaut,&#8221; he laughed.
