[This][1] is how **not** to install Tiger on an older G4:

Insert DVD.  
Listen to DVD whir.  
Realize you only have a CDRW installed, not a DVDR.  
Mutter obscenities.  
Re-visit the horror of installing the CDRW into the G4.  
Locate old slot-load DVD-Rom drive.  
Crack the G4 case and splice in the DVD-R.  
Install Tiger, and be amazed.
