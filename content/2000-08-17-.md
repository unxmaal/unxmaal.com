I&#8217;ve just finished reading &#8220;_When True Night Falls_&#8220;, by C.S. Friedman. It&#8217;s the second novel in the Coldfire Trilogy; sequel to &#8220;_Black Sun Rising_&#8220;, and I finished it in a grand total of four days. I&#8217;ll go so far as to say that this book is one of the primary causes of my current insomniac zombielike state. 

I highly recommend the entire Trilogy to anyone who is a fan of Fantasy or Science Fiction; these books comprise the best of the genre. For more information, check out [Merentha.org][1], the official C.S. Friedman fan site.

  Another cause for my insomniac zombielike state is knowing that Kevin is lying there in the other room, covered in pig-grease and war-paint, holding a sharpened hockey stick, just waiting for me to close my eyes.</p>
