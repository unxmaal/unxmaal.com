I used to use Allmusic.com several times a week, for music or band lookups and such.

Today, I noticed they&#8217;ve moved to an &#8216;account-required&#8217; format. 

I&#8217;m sure that move made perfect sense to the bitter, disenfranchised web producers at Allmusic.com, who, after being passed over for raises for three years in a row, decided that since they couldn&#8217;t get away with stabbing their CEO in the face with a blunt spoon, they&#8217;d just convince him to render the site completely un-navigable and locked-off from the rest of the Internet. In short, Allmusic.com has inserted a Desert Eagle .50 caliber handgun into its own anus, and pulled the trigger. 

Good riddance. There&#8217;s always [Amazon][1], whose band info is almost as good &#8212; and hey, they have a profit model. Imagine that.
