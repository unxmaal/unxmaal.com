Back in the AIRnet days, I dreamed of buying a few floors of the old Terry-Hutchens building in downtown Huntsville and renovating it into a completely wired living space that my friends and I would all be proud to occupy. It would be called theComplex, and I even <A HREF="http://www.nsiregistry.com/cgi-bin/whois?whois_nic=thecomplex.com&#038;type=domain">bought the domain name</A> to match. Of course, I didn&#8217;t have the business experience at the time, and had no idea how to develop such an idea.

Someone else does. I heard on <A HREF="http://www.waff.com/Global/story.asp?S=644082">the news</A> last night that: _&#8220;The developers behind <A HREF="http://www.al.com/printer/printer.ssf?/xml/story.ssf/html_standard.xsl?/base/news/10125045341665230.xml">Electric Avenue</A> are also working on another project in the Rocket City. Right now, about 8 loft-style apartments are under construction. They&#8217;re located above the Kaffe Klatsch on Jefferson Street in downtown Huntsville. The apartments have a big city look with open living areas, brick walls, and unfinished ceilings. They should be complete in about five months. So far it isn&#8217;t clear if they&#8217;ll be rented out or sold.&#8221;_

Geez, maybe I can at least get them to lose that stoopid name in favor of a better one.
