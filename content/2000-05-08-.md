Here&#8217;s the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.com/TheTropics/Paradise/1043/newphotos.html">homepage</a> of Irene de Guzman, suspected of creating the &#8220;ILOVEYOU&#8221; Outlook Exploit. 

Oooh.. now she&#8217;s _such_ a vicious-looking criminal! 

Frankly, I think all of this is a load of crap. The Feds have **no** idea who the perp is, and the stuff we see in the news media is simply damage control designed to keep us from questioning the expertise of law enforcement officials. I fully expect to see more and more of these types of exploits, considering the simplicity of modifying these scripts. 

My take? **Good riddance!** If an organization cannot or will not take action to rid itself of an insecure computer monoculture, then it deserves to be charged out the ass by **EVERY** advantageous security firm that can smell its sheeplike blood.
