I hate people.

I&#8217;m trying to move to Huntsville, VIA U-haul. So I called to reserve a truck for this weekend, and the guy at the place I call explains that they are booked up through the weekend. So&#8230;I call the next number in the list of U-haul dealers, and it turns out to be the same guy. I repeat my question, and he repeats politely that they are all booked. I&#8217;m satisfied with this, and go to the next number on the list. No answer. So I go to the next number. Disconnected. I go to the next number, and damned if I don&#8217;t get the same guy as the first two numbers. So, I decide to try and get a truck next week. I say, &#8220;I&#8217;d like to inquire about renting a truck?&#8221; And he says &#8220;WE ARE BOOKED.&#8221; and hangs up on me.  
I proceed to call back and ask to speak to his manager, whom I chew out about his employees&#8217; rude behavior, and explain to him in very colorful terms exactly WHY I will NOT be renting ANYTHING from &#8220;Grand Rental Station,&#8221; ever.
