I&#8217;ve found that Apple&#8217;s &#8220;[Sherlock][1]&#8221; tool is rather bloated and annoying when trying to use as a &#8220;file find&#8221; utility. Rather than using Sherlock, check out the freeware [Locator][2], which is a wrapper for the UNIX &#8216;find&#8217; and &#8216;locate&#8217; commands.
