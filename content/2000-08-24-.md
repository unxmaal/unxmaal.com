I found something interesting on the first day of my Intro to Fourier Analysis, in my lecture notes (the notes are actually part of a book that Dr. Howell is writing). 

These lecture notes are copyrighted according to current copyright laws, and, as they say, &#8220;all rights reserved.&#8221; Any attempt to reproduce these notes for personal profit and without the author&#8217;s permission will be found rather amusing.<sup>1</sup>  
  
<sup>1</sup> CRC Press may bee less amused. They have an expert on copyright law enforcement. His name is &#8220;Spike.&#8221;
