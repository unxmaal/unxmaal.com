[Maaaacs in SPAAAACE!][1]

Dennis Wingo, head of Huntsville, Alabama-based SkyCorp, wants to fling modified [Macintosh][2] G4 Cubes into space, where they&#8217;ll become part of a communications satellite constellation used for webhosting and email. The G4-turned-satellites will communicate with the ground with modified versions of the Apple Airport wireless-data device. 

Sure, it&#8217;s a wacko idea, but I like the concept of using lots of dirt cheap, off-the-shelf components to supplant roles commonly held by extremely expensive singular ones. Extending this concept, I&#8217;d like to see a satellite constellation made up of hundreds of thousands of Palm-Pilot-sized devices that cost less than $20 to manufacture. If one burns up, who cares? This concept also bears curious resemblance to that of the &#8220;localizer&#8221; that I posted about [here][3].
