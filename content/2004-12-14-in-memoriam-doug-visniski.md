My friend and mentor, [Doug Visniski][1], passed away this weekend. 

Doug got me my first job in Atlanta, and was my shift lead in Sprint&#8217;s IBO NOC. He had an insane amount of knowledge about networking tucked in his head, and even more knowledge about automobile mechanics. He was the only guy I knew who could remotely troubleshoot obscure physical-layer issues while putting together engine parts at his desk. 

He taught me a great deal about deep physical-layer troubleshooting, and was instrumental in maintaining the outstanding quality of service provided by the Sprint backbone during his many years with the company.

Doug is survived by his two children, Brett and Darion. 

He will be missed.

For information regarding the memorial services, please see Kayvan&#8217;s [site][2].
