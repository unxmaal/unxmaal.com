(Because I always forget)

Regarding [VNC][1]:

Port 5500 is used when connecting to a VNC server via the VNC viewer.

Port 5800 + display number is used when connecting to a VNC server with a web-browser, using the Java-based viewer. An example would be http://192.168.10.5:5805, connecting to screen #5.
