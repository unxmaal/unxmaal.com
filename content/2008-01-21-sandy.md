I&#8217;ve been testing out [Sandy][1] for a few weeks. It&#8217;s functional, and the fact that it sends SMS alerts makes it much better than standard calendar alarms. The best use I&#8217;ve found so far is to send myself reminder emails when I&#8217;m out of the office &#8212; usually that&#8217;s when I&#8217;ll discover I need to do something, and have no pen or paper handy.
