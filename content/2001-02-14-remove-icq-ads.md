More evil genius, straight from the bent minds at <A HREF="http://www.evilavatar.com/EA/News/PureEvil/M28684/">Evil Avatar</A>, here&#8217;s how to remove ICQ Ads:

Delete the following .dll files in your /ICQ directory:

> icqateima32.dll (removes advertisement downloading)
> 
> icqateimg32.dll (removes the loading of images)  
> icqateres.dll (removes part of the advertisement function)

This should make ICQ run a little faster, but the missing ads make ICQ a little uglier.
