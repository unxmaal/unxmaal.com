It seems like there has been a Pixies fetish wave or something sweeping over most of my friends lately. I&#8217;ve had my copy of Doolittle in a lot, Unx has been listening to them, and even one of my hard core goth friendshas been talking about them. Damnit, I want a reunion tour or something. Pixies rock. I spent a large portion of my high school years sitting in my bedroom, depressed as hell, playing &#8220;Wave of Mutilation&#8221; on repeat. For hours.

Wait a minute&#8230;I still do&#8230;.
