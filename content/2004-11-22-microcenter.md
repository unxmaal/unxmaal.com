While I was in line at Microcenter tonight, I witnessed just how bad at security most people are. 

Microcenter cashiers pump you for information. It&#8217;s a given. They ask for as much info as you&#8217;ll give them. There was a pretty twenty-something girl in line in front of me (I was buying Half-Life 2, of course). The cashier asked her for her address, and the girl answered. The cashier then called her by her last name, and asked her for her phone number, which the girl glady gave. Finally, the girl gave out her email address. 

What if I had been a stalker? It&#8217;s not an unreasonable assumption &#8212; it _is_ Microcenter. For the most part, information thieves are just data pickpockets, but the risks to single women are even greater. An overheard street address could have the nearest Peeping Tom hiding in your bushes a few hours later. 

This person gave out a major portion of her personal information to a total stranger, in public, where anyone could and did overhear. And she didn&#8217;t even get a free widget! At least at Linens & Things they bribe you with free dish soap. 

I thought about mentioning how dangerous her unconcern for the security of her own personal information was, but I didn&#8217;t, because she probably would&#8217;ve maced me.
