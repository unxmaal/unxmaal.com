Hey kids, if you purchased a CD or cassette tape from a retail store from a period between January 1, 1995 through December 22, 2000, you&#8217;re probably eligible to receive a check for up to $20, as a settlement agains the Music Recording Industry.

Poke [here][1] to get money!

Also note that the site requests the last 4 digits of your SSN. However, others have investigated and seem to think that the site is legit. It&#8217;s up to you to enter your information.
