Yes, Outlook Express sucks monkey nuts. 

Sadly, there&#8217;s not a better email client for Windows .. or at least one that will work with my broken work mailserver. 

OE has been taking three to four minutes to start up for a while now, and I just discovered why: it&#8217;s attempting to load all of my Instant Messaging clients, and is failing because I&#8217;ve manually removed Microsoft Messenger. 

In some versions of OE, the option for disabling this &#8216;feature&#8217; is missing. However, you can edit the registry to prevent OE from attempting to start messaging clients.
