Saturday, I bought an [IBM Deskstar][1] 46GB harddrive from [Gigaparts][2] here in town. When I got home, I realized that my motherboard didn&#8217;t support ATA100. Doh! 

A normal person would return the drive, right?

I&#8217;m not normal, so on my pal Michael&#8217;s recommendation, I drove to [NACA][3] to pick up an ATA100 controller card. When I was there, I decided that buying one of those would be stupid, since I was planning on upgrading anyway. 

Now, I&#8217;m the proud papa of a shiny new [Athlon][4] 800Mhz system. Remember, kids: Impulse-buying is good for you!
