I am now the proud owner of my first [house][1]. 

And I am _so_ tired. 

In the last 24 hours, [Laura][2] and I have ripped up carpet, ripped up carpet tacks, removed tacks, sanded, stained, and we&#8217;re still not done with the floors.

[Beth][3] drove all the way from Boaz, AL, to help us, because she&#8217;s special, and also because I was holding her old computer for ransom. Hopefully we&#8217;ll be mostly finished by tomorrow night.

Once Laura and I get our combined crap-ton of stuff moved in&#8230; party at my place.
