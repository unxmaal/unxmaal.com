[Cisco][1] has a nice new <A HREF="http://start-tac.cisco.com/Dialoging.asp">tool</A> on their website for registered users that searches their vast gigage of data for relevant articles based on questions or phrases you enter. 

The response I got was very interesting: 

> &#8220;We are working to increase the content in the TAC knowledgebase. The information you have entered throughout this session has been sent to the TAC web team to guide its knowledge development efforts.&#8221;

This is interesting, because the phrase I entered was &#8220;I am a monkey.&#8221;
