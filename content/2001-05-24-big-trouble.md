Next time some eight-foot-tall, wild-eyed maniac taps the back of your favorite head up against the barroom wall and asks you if you&#8217;ve paid your dues, well, you just do what ole Jack Burton always does at a time like that: you stare that sucker right back in the eye. 

&#8220;Have you paid your dues, Jack?&#8221; 

&#8220;Yes, sir; the check is in the mail.&#8221;
