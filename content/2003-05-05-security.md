After several weeks of study [many more than it should&#8217;ve taken], I took the [CompTIA Security+][1] Exam, and aced it with a score of 820/900. 

I spent about three weeks longer to prepare for the exam than was really necessary, because I made the terrible mistake of purchasing the [Wiley Security+ Prep Guide][2]. This book is crap. It appears that the authors wrote an &#8220;Intro to Security&#8221; handbook, realized they couldn&#8217;t sell it, and slapped a &#8220;Security+ Prep Guide&#8221; moniker upon the cover. The book is very poorly organized, with large chunks of the material spread throughout the book and referenced by &#8220;See Chapter X&#8221;. It does cover about half of the information required for the exam, but that information only takes up a tenth of the book. The rest is filled with useless trivia that is only obliquely referenced in the exam.

After three weeks of battling the Wiley book, I finally caught on to my mistake, and picked up the [Exam Cram2 Security+][3] guide. I highly recommend this book, if you intend to take the Security+ exam. It&#8217;s very dense and assumes you _understand_ the concepts covered. After going through the book, I took the chapter-end quizzes several times, and then drilled on the practice tests and the included CD. After taking the exam, I&#8217;d say this book covers about 90% of the material &#8212; there were two questions that I&#8217;d not seen covered in any test prep material, anywhere. 

Next up, either Checkpoint CCSE, or Cisco [CCNP][4]. Any opinions?
