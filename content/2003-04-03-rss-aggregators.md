I&#8217;ve been playing with [NetNewsWire][1], an RSS news aggregator for OSX. This is the first news aggregator I&#8217;ve used, and I&#8217;m very impressed. 

A news aggregator is an application that downloads information from multiple sites, usually in the form of an RSS feed. The information is normally news, or weblog posts. 

A very cool feature of NetNewsWire is that it periodically checks the feeds to which you&#8217;ve subscribed, and if it finds something new, it will download the headline and notify you.

For those of you using Windows, check out [Syndirella][2]. I&#8217;ve not used it, but it looks promising.
