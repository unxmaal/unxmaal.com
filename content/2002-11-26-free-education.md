In response to [Nyx][1]&#8216;s fine [post][2]:

I disagree.In the history of humanity, knowledge has always been the most expensive. Education should never be &#8216;free&#8217;. To consider it such devalues the knowledge gained.

I am highly suspicious of anything &#8216;free&#8217; [[TAANSTAFL][3]]. I am especially cautious of &#8216;free&#8217; education. It is, more often than not, less _education_ and more _indoctrination_. 

Consider the American education system: how to cheaply and effectively rule a population of millions? It is far less costly to rule a people with words, rather than with force. However, they must first be taught to read.
