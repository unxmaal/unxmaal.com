For those of you shopping for a new home: if you are considering purchasing a &#8220;Home Buyer&#8217;s Warranty&#8221; on the appliances in your new home, stop now.

[Home Buyer&#8217;s Warranties][1] are a scam.

The contracts come with so many fine-print loopholes, 2-10 will almost never have to pay a dime when it comes to fixing anything. In my case, the deductible cost about the same as repair visit would normally cost. The repairman took one look at my oven and suggested I replace it, due to the inner lining being rusted out. 2-10 refused to pay replacement costs, because they don&#8217;t cover damage &#8220;due to rust, within the first 30 days of closing.&#8221; 

Save your money and put it in a &#8220;rainy day&#8221; savings account, rather than falling into the [Home Buyer&#8217;s Warranty Scam][1].
