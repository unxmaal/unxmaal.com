Last night, while playing Diablo 2 on Battlenet, I was in a public game, and this jerk with the username *bloodknife went hostile on me. [In D2, players are normally allied unless they choose to fight against each other. ] This guy was level 67, and I was level 38. He killed me almost instantaneously, then stood right outside town, not letting me get my corpse. [In D2, your corpse contains your hard-won items. If you leave it, you leave them.] Each time I ran out, he&#8217;d fry me, even after promising to let me pass. He profited from this: each time he killed someone, they&#8217;d drop some money, so he was extorting them to give him all their gold before he&#8217;d let them reclaim their bodies. 

With Joseph&#8217;s help, I was finally able to reclaim my body, when *bloodknife got distracted. I left the game, went to the Battlenet chat channel, and started telling people there what had happened. 

&#8220;If anyone&#8217;s interested, there&#8217;s a jerk in game &#8220;whatever&#8221;, clvl 67 sorceress, who&#8217;s holding 5 players&#8217; corpses for ransom, extorting gold and items from them before he lets them go.&#8221; 

All these big bad lvl 90 and above Matriarchs said &#8220;No way! What an asshole! What was that game name again? We&#8217;ll take care of him!&#8221; then proceeded to join the game and destroy the jerk. I got into the game to watch the show, and took great pleasure watching four 90th level sorceresses and amazons give Mr. *bloodknife a dose of his own medicine: guarding his corpse, killing him each time he left town, until he&#8217;d lost all his money. Then he quit. All the while, I was messaging him taunts: &#8220;Aww, how&#8217;s it feel to get raped by a lvl 92 amazon? Poor thing!&#8221;

What I find interesting about all of this is how essentially unpatrolled communities like Battlenet become self-policing. Vigilante Justice at its finest.
