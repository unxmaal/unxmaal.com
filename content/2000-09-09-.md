Confession Time: I like Smashing Pumpkins. I&#8217;ve liked them since the first Gish release, back in 1991. Granted, I think Billy Corgan is a prick, but I still love his music. 

On that note, it appears that SP has released a totally new album entitled [Machina II/the friends & enemies of modern music][1]. This album consists of 25 new songs, and was pressed onto 25 vinyl LPs and given away with explicit instructions to be bootlegged and distributed across the Internet. According to fansites, this _is_ the final album from the band.
