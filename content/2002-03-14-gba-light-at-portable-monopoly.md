[PortableMonopoly.net][1] Is taking orders for the GBA FrontLights. They will install it for you and right now you get a discount if you are within the first 60 buyers. I was #3 to order. I simply cant wait to get this, I will be able to play Tony Hawk and Castlevania without the use of a 100W bulb over my shoulder. GO get one, You know your GBA needs the love.
