Somone needs to set up us the broken SGI. [The Silicon Graphics Refrigerator Project][1](or: How To Turn a $175,000 High-End SGI Challenge DM Server into a Fridge). Now this is one of the coolest Beer-drinkin&#8217; feats of engineering I&#8217;ve seen in a long time&#8230; 

If Anyone finds one of these SGIS broken somewhere&#8230; ship it to me COD.
