Macservers.org has a nice [article][1] on how to configure the built-in [Apache][2] webserver, and how to install and configure [MySQL][3] and [phpMyAdmin][4] on OSX. 

Some of the information in the Macservers article is out of date. I recommend getting the updated Mac OSX PHP 5.0 installer package from [here][5]. The newest [MySQL][6] package includes an installer for the OSX startup item script, so you won&#8217;t need to install the Entropy.ch one.
