I almost missed this while I was in Atlanta: Apparently it is now possible to run Linux on your [Dreamcast][1]. Now, this is _not_ for kids; you have to do some very scary things just to get it to boot, but it&#8217;s still very cool. Other than running [Distributed.net][2], I can&#8217;t yet imagine why anyone would want to do this&#8230; but that&#8217;s not going to stop me from trying. 

More good Dreamcast hacking info can be found at [Dan&#8217;s DCDev][3].
