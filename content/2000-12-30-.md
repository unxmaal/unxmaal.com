Scientists are [questioning][1] the popular belief that indigenous Americans were killed by imported European diseases, such as smallpox and measles. Instead, researchers are finding more evidence that the native Indian populations were decimated by a viral infection very similar to ebola. The massive social and economic changes caused by Spanish colonization, coupled with the poor living conditions forced upon native populations, contributed to a rat-borne plague that wiped out up to 17 million people.
