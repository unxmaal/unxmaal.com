For the record, I&#8217;d like to state that [Best Buy][1] officially [sucks][2]. I don&#8217;t mean in merely a polite soda-straw slurping suck, I mean in a massive vortex-of-doom cosmic sense of [sucking][3]. Think about how bad [Real Networks][4] sucks, then multiply that suckage by a million.

Best Buy&#8217;s scam is that they supposedly charge a little less than their competitors. Suppose you purchase something for $200. When you get to the register, they push this &#8221;service plan&#8221; of an extra $40. This obviously jacks the price up far more than their competitors&#8217; prices. Now, if you don&#8217;t purchase their service plan, and your purchase breaks after 1 month, tough. Their stupidly stringent policy denies you any refund, exchange, or repair. You will not get your money back, or be able to return the broken device. 

I hate [Wal-Mart][5] as much as the [next guy][6], but in this case, I&#8217;d much rather pay an extra few bucks and be guaranteed that I could return a defective product.
