Against all better judgement, I spent way too much on a fancy Balsam Hill Christmas Tree. The prior tree lasted 10 years. If the price to performance ratio holds true, this new one should last 30. 

The tree has built-in lights made by Twinkly, which has a mediocre IOS app for controlling them. 

Not satisfied with using a mere phone to manage my Christmas tree, I found a Rust-based CLI utility: [glow-control](https://github.com/cgorski/glow-control).

```
 glow-control device-call --ip 192.168.3.31 --mac 8p:zz:15:92:h4:xb print-config                                                          

The device configuration:
