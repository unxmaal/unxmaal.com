Yays! [NetNewsWire][1] is now a free download!

I used NNW for ages, a few years ago, but switched to Google Reader after NNW started asking me for my moneys. I find that NNW&#8217;s keyboard shortcuts are a lot faster than Google Reader&#8217;s, and the general experience is better. Another nice new feature is that news subscriptions sync between multiple copies of NetNewsWire via Newsgator.
