For everyone who has ever wondered what the real meaning is behind the anime-that-kicks-you-in-the-head-yes-even-more-than-Akira, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.advfilms.com/catitem.html?c=all&#038;k=ev001" >Neon Genesis Evangelion</a>, check out <a target="_blank" href="http://www.toastyfrog.com/jump/or-thumbnail/evatt-26.shtml">Toastyfrog&#8217;s Summary of Eva Episode 26</a>, which is basically a overly artsy-fartsy Hideaki Anno getting symbolic on our asses.  
Read it, and think, &#8220;You know, that literal interpretation of the symbolism was right all along. I was a fool to compare Eva to something as overly complex and intellectually grasping as <a target="_blank" href="http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/schung/evachars.html">the Qabalah</a>&#8230;&#8221;  
And if it piques your interest, don&#8217;t bother reading 40 different webpages that all copied the info from each other; click <a target="_blank" href="http://www.westfieldnetwork.com/animetopia/old/mysteries.html">here</a> for a nice concise list of pretty much every theory currently held in the internet community, regarding EVA symbolism.

  Personally, I hate ADVision. Don&#8217;t buy their crap-ass DVDs, go get the subtitled VCDs from some import place.</font>
