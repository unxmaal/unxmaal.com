Absolutely gorgeous: pixie-small with big brown eyes, pale complexion, and her black hair tied up in a red kerchief that matched her red lipstick. 

&#8220;Having a good day?&#8221; I asked.

She grinned and rolled her eyes, &#8220;Good and bad.&#8221; She whispered, &#8220;I _hate_ the guy I&#8217;m working with.&#8221;

I smile sympathetically. 

&#8220;But today&#8217;s my last day, which is fun, but sad in a way.&#8221;

&#8220;Going to a new job?&#8221;

&#8220;No, I&#8217;m going to college.&#8221;

&#8220;Really? Georgia Tech?&#8221;

She looked down and out and away for a moment. &#8220;Actually I&#8217;m going to Boston University.&#8221; 

&#8220;I don&#8217;t know very much about Boston, except that the traffic sucks.&#8221;

Again that brilliant and expressive smile flashed. &#8220;Yeah, during orientation the guide told us to be especially careful not to get hit by cars or trains.&#8221; 

We both laugh, and she hands me my coffee and with the transferral of the plastic cup from her hands to mine, the tiniest of all relationships was over. 

&#8220;Well&#8230; Enjoy your college,&#8221; I say. 

&#8220;Thanks!&#8221; she said, and smiled. 

I will never see her again, whatever her name is.
