I was so impressed with the  [Bradd Pitt blog][1] that I decided to create one of my own. So I thought about something that would be kind of cute to do, and I came up with a girl who is involved in some bizarre cult based out of Huntsville. This has nothing to do with my own life, and the characters are not modeled after my friends. I swear. No, really. And I am definitely not like  [Killer Ciara.][2] Really, I&#8217;m not&#8230;
