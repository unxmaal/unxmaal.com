I really like the idea of a <A HREF="http://www.sunday-times.co.uk/news/pages/sti/2000/06/04/stifgnusa01004.html?">vaccine</A> for cocaine. Essentially, if you&#8217;re an addict, you can take a shot of the vaccine, and from then on cocaine will have no effect on you, as your body&#8217;s immune system will treat the drug as if it were a foreign invader. 

On the other hand, I don&#8217;t think this will fix this country&#8217;s &#8220;drug problem&#8221; problem.

I personally view dependency on drugs for recreation as a critical weakness: in your compulsively-ordered, over-controlled life, the only fun or adventure you can fit into your plastic-wrapped day comes in the form of a gel-wrapped pill, or a glass bottle, or a stub of paper. 

However, that&#8217;s fine by me, so long as you keep whatever you do in your own home to yourself. I fully acknowledge (as I think most Americans do, in their deepest hearts) that the &#8216;War on Drugs&#8217; is a sham designed to keep those Good Ole Boys Downtown employed, because there&#8217;s really no other work out there for them. Fascist that I am, I am all for legalizing all drugs, from aspirin to black tar heroin. I&#8217;m also for instituting an instant death penalty against anyone who injures anyone else while under the influence of these newly-licit treasures. 

I&#8217;m also realistic enough to know that this will never happen, ever. Too many extremely powerful groups are making too much money off of the WoD for it to ever go away. 

As a final thought: kids today are making everything from methamphetamines to fission reactors in their own garages. How well do you think the WoD will hold up when, fifteen, twenty years from now, kids are able to synthesize totally unheard-of new drugs with their own science playsets? Even better, what happens when these same kids start tweaking their own DNA with home-brew retroviruses?

Strange days, indeed.
