It&#8217;s 5:30 in the morning, and Robert and I are considering our ages in hexadecimal. I blame [Marcia][1] for this, entirely. 

**Me**: How old am I in hex?  
**Robert**: Um.. ok, let&#8217;s see.. carry the one, divide by..  
**Me**: Ok, I&#8217;m 1B.  
**Robert**: You cheat. You used [calc.exe][2].  
**Me**: So? How old are you?  
**Robert**: Hmm.. I&#8217;m.. how old is [Jeff][3]?  
**Me**: What?! You can&#8217;t use [Jeff][3] as an age reference! When were you born?!  
**Robert**: I can&#8217;t remember that far back..  
**Me**: Jeff&#8217;s as old as my sister, and she was born in 1977.  
**Robert**: I must be &#8230; dude, I&#8217;m 18!  
**Me**: In hex.
