_Me, to my British friend_: It&#8217;s way hot here, in Atlanta. It&#8217;s 90-something Fahrenheit, and humid.  
_My British friend_: In Celsius?  
_Me, to Smarterchild_: Smarterchild! I command thee! Convert 90F to Celsius!  
_[Smarterchild][1]_: There are 32.222222 ??c in 90 ??f, my liege!  
_Me, to MBF_: 32?? C  
_MBF_:Erk! I would die! I can&#8217;t leave the house if it gets that hot! How do you survive?  
_Me_: I sprint across the parking lot to my car. My car, being a Ford, has the air-conditioning of Christ, and can drop the temperature inside from about 110??F inside the car to a nice 70??F in 5 minutes. I open the door, jump back to let the blast of hot air pass, jump in the car, start it, turn the AC on HIGH, roll down the windows, drive out of the apartment complex really fast so the engine assists the compressor, then roll up the windows. By the time I&#8217;m on the highway to work, it&#8217;s fairly comfortable. Once I get to work, I park the car, and sprint to the nicely-airconditioned building.
