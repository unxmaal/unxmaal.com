Thanks again to the hundreds (okay, okay, _dozens_) who have sent me cheer-up emails, icqs, cards, flowers, and dancing girls. I&#8217;ll be sure to remember you all when your current love interest copulates with a guy named Rupert. 

I&#8217;m really feeling a lot better. I did the ritual Reclaiming-of-Stuff on Friday, dumping off three years&#8217; worth of stuff, and getting my answering machine and the little computer I&#8217;d loaned her. Some of my friends had urged me to get the VCR and Playstation, but no, those were _gifts_ I&#8217;d given her; I just wanted what was rightfully mine. 

I consider this to be an end, of sorts. Now that I&#8217;ve Gotten My Stuff, I&#8217;m no longer Obligated to Think About Her. If I do, that&#8217;s my own fault for wallowing in my misery. 

And quite frankly, I think that two days of grieving is all she&#8217;s worth.
