For people who have allergies, love techie toys, don&#8217;t like lawnwork,  
or people like me who simply loathe the outdoors, I present to you: <a target ="_blank" Href = "http://www.robomow.com/">Robomow.</a>  
I have a **serious** robot fetish, and I must confess, after being fascinated by a childhood toy;  
a truck that follows a crayon drawn line, I had this same idea. But I never thought to pursue it.  
Foolish me.
