One technology I&#8217;ve been keeping an eye out for is that of the &#8220;localizer&#8221;, as described in the novel _[A Deepness In The Sky][1]_, by Vernor Vinge. In &#8220;Deepness&#8221;, localizers are miniscule devices capable of distributed data processing, inter- and extra-device communication, movement, and environmental sensing. These devices play a key role in the development of societies towards a space-faring culture. Two articles on current research regarding this tech: Berkeley&#8217;s Wireless Research Center&#8217;s [picoradio][2] project, and their [smart dust][3] project.
