Matt Rossi called my ex a harridan, over on [Fire bad, weblogs good!][1] He also did a nice review of the site. At least, I _think_ &#8220;delightful neuropeptide broth&#8221; is a compliment.

Of course, being an illiterate heathen, I can&#8217;t remember what harridan meant. Here&#8217;s the [definition][2].
