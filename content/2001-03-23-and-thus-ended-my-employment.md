And thus ended my employment for <A HREF="http://www.nasa.gov/">NASA</A>: not with a bang, not with a whimper, but with the shuffling of paperwork, and the clicking of lacquered nails against a keyboard. 

It is sad, in a way. I will miss the great group of people I worked with. However, I&#8217;m really looking forward to Atlanta, and to working at [Sprint][1].
