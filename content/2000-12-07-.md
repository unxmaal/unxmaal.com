Everything you know about history is [wrong][1]. 

The older I get, the more I discover that the simple facts and truths I was taught in school and lectured on in college are not so simple and, indeed, not as factual, as I was led to believe. According to this article, there is growing dissatisfaction with the common chronology of history &#8212; to such a point that some question the validity of any historical timeline that goes back before 4AD. 

Shaky ground, indeed. My own experience in the networking industry maps well to this suddenly threadbare societal cushion: if most people really knew (as I do) just how much of computer tech is guesswork and duct-tape, there would be much less sleep around the world. For that matter, just how safe _is_ that airplane? How sure can you be that your soft-drink is non-toxic? Once you begin questioning the basic assumptions of your life, you start to see the holes in your knowledge. 

The holes aren&#8217;t what bothers me, though.

It&#8217;s those scary yellow eyes that are looking back&#8230;
