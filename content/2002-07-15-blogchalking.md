I am Jack&#8217;s Jump onto the Bandwagon. 

Google! DayPop! This is my **[blogchalk][1]**: English, United States, Atlanta, Smyrna, Eric, Male, 26-30!

Even in a city this size, with at least fifteen other webloggers, I&#8217;ve only met [one][2] in person who isn&#8217;t one of the original Flogeeks crew. If you know someone who shares common interests online, is it necessarily a good idea to meet them offline?
