Ooh, fun with [Google][1]:

With [Google sets][2], you enter a few related items, and Google will attempt to find more items in that set. For example, I listed several industrial bands: VNV Nation, Nine Inch Nails, Skinny Puppy, Laibach, and Coil, and Google returned this [expanded set][3]. 

Another nice Google [feature][4] eliminates the need to wait on sites with slow or nonexistent search functions. In Google&#8217;s search box, append site:sitename to your query, and Google will only return results from that site. For example, if you enter your query as &#8220;site:www.orbyn.com hair fudge&#8221; (note no http://), you&#8217;ll get an interesting result from [Robyn][5]&#8216;s page, as well as giving her lots of interesting search referrals.
