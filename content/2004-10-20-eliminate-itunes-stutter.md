iTunes stutters. Y-Yu-Y-You heard me. It didn&#8217;t always do this, though. When I first ran iTunes on my PC, it was a wondrous revelation&#8230; but recently, probably after a software update, it developed a stutter. I got fed up tonight and searched until I found the answer buried in an Apple messageboard, away from Google&#8217;s prying eyes. The culprit: DirectSound.

Yes, Apple is now using Microsoft&#8217;s pitiful DirectSound via QuickTime to play iTunes music. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s always been this way (I don&#8217;t think so), but the way to remedy the stutter is to close iTunes, open QuickTime preferences, and change the &#8216;Sound Out&#8217; from DirectSound to something more reasonable, like &#8216;Wave Out.&#8217; Close QuickTime Preferences, open iTunes, and poof! Stutter banished.

Yes, I know I should buy a Mac. I have. Actually, five. And that&#8217;s just the new ones over the years. But I use my PCs, too, and with 1GB of ram, my 2.4GHz main desktop PC should not have had any trouble with iTunes&#8230; Our Powerbooks sure don&#8217;t.
