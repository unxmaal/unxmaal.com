Not entirely sure what&#8217;s going on, but lately I&#8217;ve got a ton of fake referrer entries from various sites&#8217; mt-comments.cgi &#8212; and they all come from one IP: 66.98.210.44 .

Luckily, I know the magic of .htaccess, so now nobody from &#8220;Everyone&#8217;s Internet&#8221; can read my page. And good damn riddance.

Here&#8217;s an example of the log files:

<tt><br /> 66.98.210.44 - - [02/Sep/2004:20:05:43 -0400] "GET /mt/archives/002005.html HTTP/1.1" 200 16969 "http://WWW.katiehood.COM/cgi/mt-comments.cgi" "Windows XP Internet Explorer 6.x"<br /> 66.98.210.44 - - [02/Sep/2004:21:22:24 -0400] "GET /mt/archives/001302.html HTTP/1.1" 200 17057 "http://zero12.securesites.net/cgi-bin/mt/mt-comments.cgi" "Windows XP Internet Explorer 6.x"<br /> 66.98.210.44 - - [02/Sep/2004:21:39:55 -0400] "GET /mt/archives/001981.html HTTP/1.1" 200 17365 "http://www.thoughtbomb.net/cgi-bin/mt/mt-comments.cgi" "Windows XP Internet Explorer 6.x"<br /> 66.98.210.44 - - [02/Sep/2004:22:26:51 -0400] "GET /mt/archives/001467.html HTTP/1.1" 200 16895 "http://www.graysathletic.co.uk/cgi-bin/mt/mt-comments.cgi" "Windows XP Internet Explorer 6.x"</tt>

And the .htaccess file (doesn&#8217;t block EI&#8217;s whole range, but it&#8217;s good enough):  
<tt><br /> <Limit GET HEAD POST><br /> order allow,deny<br /> deny from 66.98.210<br /> allow from all<br /> </LIMIT> </tt>
