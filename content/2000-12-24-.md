Thanks to my dad, I got a [Victorinox CyberTool][1]. This great little pocketknife has all the tools a hardware geek might need, from a socket driver and bits to scissors and pliers. 

Yeah, I know, it&#8217;s named &#8220;CyberTool&#8221;, which is terribly reminiscent of something you&#8217;d hear in [Lawnmower Man 2][2]. I keep wanting to lisp the word &#8220;Cyber&#8221; any time I hear it.
