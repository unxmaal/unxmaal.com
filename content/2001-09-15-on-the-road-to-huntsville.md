On my way to Huntsville this afternoon, I felt a constant sense of wrongness, as if I&#8217;d slipped into a parallel universe. Granted, this whole week has been a Twilight Zone diversion from normalcy, but the pervasive strangeness was more apparent while driving 80MPH down the interstate. I saw flags at half-mast, countless marquees urging people to pray, or to give blood, but the most distinct sign that _yes, indeed this is for real_ happened on I-20, just before the Alabama state line.
