The [Eudora][1] mail client has a nice little feature called &#8220;Moodwatch&#8221; that is intended to determine if an email might be offensive to a recipient. I don&#8217;t think Eudora ever considered someone might be sending [Anthrax lyrics][2], as you can see <a target="_top" href="javascript:openScript('images/warning.jpg',382,194)">here</a>.
