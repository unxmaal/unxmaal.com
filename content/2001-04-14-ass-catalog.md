I can&#8217;t begin to tell you of the wonders of the <A HREF="http://www.sciplus.com/">ASS Catalog</A>: American Science & Surplus. Random bits of everything cool are located here for extremely low prices. We&#8217;re talking Gieger counters, gas masks, lab sets, lasers, crayons, plastic snakes, piezo speakers, and tons of other great junk that I truly don&#8217;t need and yet truly lust after.
