Today I added a cute little CSS pseudoclass to my stylesheet. If you mouse over the link boxes on the sides, you&#8217;ll see the box color change to highlight the selected box.

Unfortunately, this effect only works with browsers that support the CSS :hover pseudoclass properly. I recommend [Mozilla][1], or [Safari][2], if you&#8217;re running OSX.

This effect does not work in Internet Explorer 6 for Windows. 

Consider this [article][3]:  **&#8220;IE6 SP1 is the final standalone installation.&#8221; &#8230; &#8220;Legacy OSes have reached their zenith with the addition of IE 6 SP1. Further improvements to IE will require enhancements to the underlying OS.&#8221;**

Want to keep using Internet Explorer, and also want it to properly support modern web standards? You&#8217;ll have to upgrade to the next version of Windows, (which won&#8217;t be released until the scheduled date of 2010), or you can subscribe to MSN, paying Microsoft a monthly fee to rent your browser.
