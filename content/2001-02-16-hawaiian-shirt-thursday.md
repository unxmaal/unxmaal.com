I&#8217;ve been memetically-engineering the folks at work. I wore this godawful [Hawaiian shirt][1] yesterday. 

Everyone said something to me about it, and I looked at them and said, &#8220;It&#8217;s Hawaiian-shirt-Thursday.&#8221;

&#8220;No it&#8217;s not!&#8221;

&#8220;Yes,it is!&#8221; I said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you even READ your email?!&#8221; And I went on and on about it because I know they all trash corporate email without looking at it.

Next Thursday I&#8217;m sure some people will be wearing Hawaiian shirts.
