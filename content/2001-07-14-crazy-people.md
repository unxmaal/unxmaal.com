Sometimes, I think ignorance really would be bliss. Sometimes I envy people that are so bat-bangin&#8217; insane that they are free enough to do stuff like this guy: [Leather Chaps Man][1]. Here&#8217;s a man who&#8217;s so far into his own universe that he&#8217;s oblivious to the world around him &#8212; and in his universe, he&#8217;s one hot dude.
