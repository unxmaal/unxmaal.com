My co-worker Matt is joining the National Guard, and is going to Basic Training in a few days. We kid him that his training will consist of being handed a gun and getting sand kicked in his face, before they put him on the boat for Iraq.

Today he was complaining about writing a script to test a crash caused by fuser. 

Matt: &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m getting paid to write a virus payload.&#8221;  
Me: &#8220;It&#8217;s the same thing as what you&#8217;ll be doing in Iraq, except instead of machines you&#8217;ll be killin&#8217; filthy terrists.&#8221;  
Matt: &#8220;&#8230;&#8221;  
Me: &#8220;You definitely need to name your test system Osama. Then have your system crasher deploy into /bin/laden .&#8221;
