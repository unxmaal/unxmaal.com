Tonight I&#8217;ve been playing with [Zo???][1]. The manual is nonexistent, and the &#8216;About&#8217; page degenerates into an existentialist rant, so I&#8217;ll explain the application:

Zo??? is a Java application that acts as a self-contained POP3/IMAP client. It can download copies of your email from your mailserver(s), and can also import your stored mails from your current system (if said email is stored in an mbox format). It then indexes all inbound email, and generates a webpage that shows a concise view of important info, such as a timeline view, all hyperlinks in the emails you&#8217;ve received for x day, all people who&#8217;ve mailed you that day, and all the attachments you&#8217;ve gotten. Even better, it allows you to do a google-like search on that email. Zo??? also acts like an SMTP server, in that it can index your outgoing mail as well: configure your regular mail client to send mail through localhost:10080, and Zo??? will nab outgoing mails, index them, and forward them on to the regular SMTP server.

For now, Zo??? seems like a highly beta application. I hope that it will be able to parse through my old Pine and Mutt mail archives soon, as well as my existing Eudora mail archives. The ability to do Google-like searches on those mails would be an excellent time-saver.
