The iPod has a warranty of only a year (which does suck). After the year&#8217;s up,  
you have to pay Apple to do any work on it.

So <a href=http://www.ipodsdirtysecret.com/">some guy</a> is crying because Apple is charging him $250 to replace the battery in something that&#8217;s out of warranty?

Because he doesn&#8217;t want to do it himself for [$50][1]?

What a crybaby. He probably cried when he got kicked off the soccer team for crying too much.

If Apple ends up giving him a free new battery for his out-of-warranty  
iPod, I wonder if they&#8217;ll give me a new motherboard for that old Apple  
IIci I&#8217;ve got in the garage. 

Hey, and then I&#8217;ll ask Nissan if they&#8217;ll give me a free new transmission  
on that 1981 Datsun 210 that&#8217;s stashed out back.

Oh, and those Starbucks bastards are in for it. That mocha I got this morning? It&#8217;s empty now, and they&#8217;d better damn well refill it for free.
