Much to my delight (and to the dispair of my friends), I have discovered a band possibly more irritating than [Cibo Matto][1]:

<A HREF="http://www.buyersphere.com/buyersphere/coin.html">Coin</a>. 

The best way to describe Coin&#8217;s music is to imagine locking yourself inside a videogame arcade for a whole Saturday, with all the machines on &#8220;Free-Play&#8221;, while a horde of Ritalin-doped Cub Scouts wage life-or-death Joust tournaments.
