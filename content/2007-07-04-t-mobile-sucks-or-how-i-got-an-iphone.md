On Saturday, when my Blackberry 7100t crashed three times, I was annoyed but not concerned. It crashed a few more times on Sunday, so I wiped and reinstalled it. The phone was ok all Monday, but on Tuesday, mid-conversation, the speaker went out. I rebooted it a few times, and even disassembled it to clean it out. Nothing helped. The trusty Blackberry was toast (or jam?)

This was a big problem, since I&#8217;m on-call this week, and have some precariously-balanced systems that I expect to fail very soon.

I&#8217;ve been a T-mobile customer for ten years. I&#8217;ve paid for the insurance on my phones the whole time. At about $6/month, I&#8217;ve more than paid for several phones. I called the aptly-named &#8220;Assurion&#8221; company, who, after much wrangling, said the best they could do was to send me a new phone &#8220;within five to seven business days.&#8221; No word on what I&#8217;d do before then.

I called T-mobile customer care. After arguing for half and hour, the fastest they could get me a phone would involve signing a new two-year contract and paying $230 to &#8220;upgrade&#8221; to a new Blackberry Pearl. 

&#8220;Since I&#8217;ll have to sign a contract anyway, why should I not go to the Apple store and buy an iPhone?&#8221; 

&#8220;&#8230; Sir, you could do that, and we&#8217;d hate to lose you as a customer, but we don&#8217;t have a loaner program for the Blackberry phones.&#8221;

&#8220;Right. Enjoy your unemployment, when AT&T or Sprint buys T-Mobile at fire sale prices.&#8221; Click.

Oh, and yes, the iPhone _is_ worth all the hype.
