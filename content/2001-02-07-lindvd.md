[Intervideo][1] has announced the first legal software DVD player for Linux, <a HREF="http://www.intervideo.com/jsp/Products.jsp?mode=LinDVD">LinDVD</A>. 

At first I thought &#8220;this sucks, and I&#8217;m never gonna buy it,&#8221; but then I realized that Intervideo never intended for me to be a direct customer. Instead, I suspect that this is designed for thin-client, set-top box machines, which would be a great niche for the OS and the player. I&#8217;d definitely buy this if it came wrapped inside an inexpensive palmtop DVD player.
