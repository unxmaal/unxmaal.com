Note to the three females who read this site: [Reflect.com][1] looks like a really neat idea to me. It allows you to custom-design your own makeup and beauty products and have them shipped to your house. I really like customization, but I don&#8217;t know enough about the arcane arts of cosmetology to tell if this service is really useful. Please post comments below. =]
