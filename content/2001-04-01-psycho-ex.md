For those of you so lagged you still think that [AYBABTU][1] is &#8220;really funny,&#8221; be warned that the next meme-in-waiting, PsychoExgirlfriend.com, is a <A HREF="http://www.newstrolls.com/news/dev/downes/column010329.htm">hoax</A>.

**Update:** Apparently, my ultra-leet hosts file blocks all the really annoying things from happening on _my_ computer. I didn&#8217;t truly understand the awfulness of the popup windows until someone complained about my link. My apologies; I&#8217;ve removed the link to PsychoExgirlfriend.com. Visit the page at your own risk.
