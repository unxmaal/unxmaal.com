Great. Just a few months after I move away from Huntsville, some company decides to demonstrate <A title="No, it's not really antigravity. Don't be silly." HREF="http://www.tdimension.com/press_releases/press_release_6_25_01.html">antigravity</A>, just a few miles from where I used to live. If [Rod][1] doesn&#8217;t go to this thing and take pictures, I&#8217;ll be so disappointed.
