Concerned about buying a music CD that won&#8217;t play in your home PC or car stereo due to [copy protection][1]? Check [Fatchuck&#8217;s Corrupt CD List][2] before you buy a CD. Also, be sure to purchase new CDs with a credit card, so if they are &#8220;defective&#8221;, you can return them and contest the charges with your creditor.
