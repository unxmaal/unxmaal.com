Wondering which processor is right for you? Curious about the history of microprocessors? I found an [article][1] today that has some decently indepth views about the history processors and how they work. This tells about the mistakes and advancements in the microprocessor world. Comparisons between CISC and RISC, Motorola, Intel, and AMD. It&#8217;s a good read if you have some time. I found the first part somewhat biased against Intel but it seems to be well written. 

According to this [article][2] Intel Developers were under some bad pressure from management and other forces and ended up making the Pentium 4 no better off than the P3. I&#8217;m not about to buy an AMD chip yet, but we&#8217;ll see how the market develops over the next months.
