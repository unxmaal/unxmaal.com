Since cron still doesn&#8217;t work, I have to run my log-analysis scripts by hand. This means I usually forget to run them at all. I ran them last night and found that my <A HREF="http://unxmaal.com/reports/log.keys.html">most commonly-searched-for phrase</A> is &#8220;panties&#8221; and &#8220;ugly men&#8221;. 

It&#8217;s so nice to know your demographic.
