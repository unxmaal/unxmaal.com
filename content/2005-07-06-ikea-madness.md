Heather and I donned battle armor and braved the new [Ikea][1]store on Monday morning. The store is like an enormous theme park for trendy-but-thrifty adults, complete with a neato magnetic-locking freight escalator as a &#8216;ride&#8217;. I could&#8217;ve blown a lot more money than I did, but I managed to escape with only a TV stand.
