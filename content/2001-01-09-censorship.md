This is an excellent [commentary][1] by Patricia Nell Warren regarding the National Academy of Science&#8217;s [_Workshop on Non-Technical Strategies to Protect Youth from Inappropriate Material on the Internet_][2], [<font size="1">pointy-headspeak for Internet Porn Blocking</font>]. It&#8217;s important to note that Ms. Warren is almost 65 years old, and has impressive credentials in both law and education. A good comment:

> &#8220;It amazes me to see parents who support &#8220;family values&#8221; demanding government censorship on the Net. In other words, their family values have failed, and they can&#8217;t control their children, so they expect the government to control the situation for them.&#8221;

All I care about is that the United States Federal Government does not receive the right to censor the Internet. That&#8217;s all. If you want your state, your town, or your community to have censorship rights, fine. If you want to pay money to an ISP that will filter content for you, that&#8217;s fine too. However, I will never condone any governmental legislature that seeks to censor speech (and thus thought). If the thoughts you deem &#8220;healthy&#8221; and &#8220;moral&#8221; are so weak and unconvincing that the argurments for them cannot outweigh those for the concepts and ideas you deem &#8220;wrong&#8221; and &#8220;evil&#8221;, your thoughts and ideas deserve to die.
