I&#8217;ve scheduled my CCNA exam for a couple of weeks from now, so I&#8217;ve been studying like a madman.

Normally I&#8217;ll get up in the morning, eat breakfast, and go to Starbuck&#8217;s, which is now my &#8220;office&#8221;. I study from about 8AM until 2PM, then go home for lunch. Today, I got done with a chapter early, and after going home for lunch, decided to stay and study. 

Me: I decided to stay home this afternoon and study here.

Laura: aww

Me: It sucks and is less comfortable, and I have to wear a hat.

Laura: A hat?

Me: We forgot to pay the gravity bill.

Me: So now there&#8217;s a lot of STUFF floating around.

Laura: \*blink\*

Me: The cat is _not_ very happy about it.
