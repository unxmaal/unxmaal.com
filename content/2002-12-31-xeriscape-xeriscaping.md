The term &#8220;[Xeriscape][1]&#8221; was coined by the [Denver Water Department][2] in 1981. The word is a combination of &#8220;landscape&#8221; and the Greek word &#8220;xeros,&#8221; which means &#8220;dry.&#8221; The primary goal of Xeriscaping is to create sustainable landscapes that require a minimum of water, while still remaining attractive.

More Xeriscaping info can be found [here][3].

For those of you in the Atlanta area, the City of Atlanta provides [free consultation][4] by Summer Xeriscape Interns.
