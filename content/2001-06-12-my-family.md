It&#8217;s true, kids. I come from a long line of <A HREF="http://www.honkytime.faithweb.com/index.html">Honkies</A>. One branch of the Dodd family contained so many horse thieves (in the 19th century), that all the people bearing that surname in that area changed their name. 

Granted, they were not the brightest of folk. They all changed their name to &#8220;Dodds&#8221;, thinking the &#8216;s&#8217; was distinctive.
