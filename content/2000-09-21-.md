Wow! [Abebooks.com][1] is &#8220;the world&#8217;s largest web-based network of independent booksellers.&#8221; It&#8217;s a great way to find rare and out-of-print books, and is going to be the way I start my Horror and Science Fiction library. 

[Those][2] of [you][3] who [didn&#8217;t][4] get me [birthday][5] presents can atone for your sins by donating books to the &#8220;Entertain Eric Fund&#8221;.
