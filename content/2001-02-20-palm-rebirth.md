I feel that I&#8217;ve accomplished something today. My little <A HREF="http://www.palm.com/">Palm IIIx</A>, on which I&#8217;ve lavished so much attention and cash, died today. üôÅ

When I turned it on, all I saw on the screen were alternating vertical lines. I replaced the batteries, backed up my software, did soft resets, hard resets, to no avail. I finally called Palm Tech Support, who didn&#8217;t answer any questions and merely wanted me to fork over $100 for repair. By this time, I&#8217;d already taken the case off, so I declined their kind offer. I found the ribbon cable that goes from the board to the display, and shoved it back into its socket. I put the case back on, replaced the batteries, and it started up, as good as new. 

I think &#8220;Lazarus&#8221; is a good name for a Palm Pilot.
