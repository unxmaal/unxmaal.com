Phase B is now complete!

The import from MT to WP went very quickly. The only &#8216;gotcha&#8217; is that PHP hates importing text files of over 1MB (unless you screw with the php.ini settings), so I had to manually split the import.txt file into several smaller chunks. 

As you can see, a few minor cosmetic glitches remain. I&#8217;m still not sure what&#8217;s up with the post title, but I&#8217;ll work on that later.
