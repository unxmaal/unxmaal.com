Ahh, the [lyrics][1] to the [Red Dwarf][2] theme song:

<center>
  It&#8217;s cold outside,<br /> there&#8217;s no kind of atmosphere <br />I&#8217;m all alone, more or less <br />Let me fly far away from here <br />Fun, fun, fun in the sun, sun, sun </p> 
  
  <p>
    I want to lie shipwrecked and comatose <br />Drinking fresh mango juice <br />Goldfish shoals nibbling at my toes <br />Fun, fun, fun in the sun, sun, sun <br />Fun, fun, fun in the sun, sun, sun<br /></center>
  </p>
