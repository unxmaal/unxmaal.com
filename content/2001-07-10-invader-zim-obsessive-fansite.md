[Invader Zim Obsessive Anonymous][1] is another great Invader Zim fansite. There&#8217;s a few nice .wav files for download, and some screen captures. 

Sadly, since the untimely death of my Tivo, I can no longer watch Invader Zim. I suppose I could hook up the VCR properly, but that would involve crawling amongst the deadly wire nest behind the TV. _Here there be tygers._
