Windows users, listen up:

[iTunes][1] for Windows is **free**. It doesn&#8217;t cost anything. It will play your existing MP3 files just fine. It will rip your CDs just fine, and you still don&#8217;t have to pay a dime to Apple. It&#8217;ll keep your MP3s organized, and you _still don&#8217;t have to pay any money to anyone_. 

It can also show trippy visual effects when you play your MP3s, and yeah, those effects are free, too. 

In fact, the only time you&#8217;ll have to pay for anything related to iTunes is if you want to spend $0.99 on a song that you can purchase from the iTunes music store. (That song, incidentally, isn&#8217;t an MP3. It&#8217;s encoded in a different format &#8211;AAC). 

Free software, folks. 

So what are you waiting for? [Go try it][2]. It&#8217;s worlds beyond Winamp or Windows Media Player. You&#8217;ll be pleasantly suprised.
