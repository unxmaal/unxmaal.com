I&#8217;m impressed with [Ubiquity][1]. It&#8217;s very similar to my favorite Mac app, [Quicksilver][2]. Instead of telling Firefox _where to go_, Ubiquity allows the user to tell Firefox _what to do_, including: open a map, email someone, Digg something, tag something, show you the weather, or look something up.
