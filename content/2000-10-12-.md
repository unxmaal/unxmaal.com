<a/href="http://my.aol.com/news/story.tmpl?table=n&cat=0110&id=0010120205128427" >This<a /> story talks about my all time favorite game, Tetris, and how people with total amnesia can remember the tetris shapes when they can&#8217;t remember anything else.  
  
This is no surprise to me. When I was in high school and had no car and no social life to speak of, I sat in my room and played Tetris for hours on end, until every shape I saw I would figure out how to fit a Tetris shape into it. It got bad. I was a Tetris junkie. Couldn&#8217;t live without it. I only got over it by passing the Gameboy on to my dad, who would then become a Tetris addict for the next two months, then pass it back to me, whereupon we would start the whole, vicious Tetris cycle over again.  
  
God, I miss that game. I need to get some batteries for my gameboy&#8230;..
