In Milwaukie, OR, someone turned a [B-17 Bomber][1] into a gas station/restaurant. 

From [The Register][2]: 

> &#8220;Milwaukie, Oregon &#8211; only in America can you beat a B-17 into a gas station.
> 
> Shortly after WWII a guy named Art Lacey (he had a British wife) went to Kansas to buy a surplus B-17. His idea was to fly it back to Oregon, jack it up in the air and make a gas station out of it. He paid $15,000 for it. He asked which one was his and they said take whichever you want because there were miles of them. He didn&#8217;t know how to fly a 4 engine airplane so he read the manual while he taxied around by himself. They said he couldn&#8217;t take off alone so he put a mannequin in the co-pilot&#8217;s seat and off he went.
> 
> He flew around a bit to get the feel of it and when he went to land he realized he needed a co-pilot to lower the landing gear. He crashed and totaled his plane and another on the ground. They wrote them both off as &#8220;wind damaged&#8221; and told him to pick out another. He talked a friend into being his co-pilot and off they went.
> 
> They flew to Palm Springs where Lacey wrote a hot check for gas then they headed for Oregon. They hit a snow storm and couldn&#8217;t find their way so they went down below 1,000 feet and followed the railroad tracks. His partner sat in the nose section and would yell, &#8220;TUNNEL&#8221; when he saw one and Lacey would climb over the mountain.
> 
> They landed safely, he made good the hot check he wrote, and they started getting permits to move a B-17 on the state highway. The highway department repeatedly denied his permit and fought him tooth and nail for a long time so late one Saturday night he just moved it himself. He got a $10 ticket from the police for having too wide a load.&#8221;
