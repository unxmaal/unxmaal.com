[Apple to Supply iBooks for Cobb County][1]

> Apple???? today announced that the Cobb County School District has selected Apple as its supplier in the largest ever one-to-one computer learning initiative. The district&#8217;s program, named &#8220;Power To Learn,&#8221; plans for Apple to provide iBook???? G4s to every student and teacher in the district, starting with deployment this fall of more than 17,000 iBooks for teachers district-wide and students at four high schools designated as demonstration sites. Pending school board approval, the second and third phases of the program will equip all Cobb County high school and middle school students with iBooks beginning in 2006, resulting in a total deployment of 63,000 iBooks.

Too bad I&#8217;m not a high school student in Georgia.
