For all you kids who&#8217;re trying to add me to your LinkedIn accounts: piss off. 

It&#8217;s really, really stupid to pay someone to &#8220;network&#8221; you with people you already know. 

Here&#8217;s a crushing blow to LinkedIn&#8217;s @1998 business model: send some email. Yeah, that&#8217;s right, _send email to your old colleagues_. 

Novel concept. 

Now quit spamming me, monkeys.
