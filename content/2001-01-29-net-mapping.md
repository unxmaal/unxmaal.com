In the search for better [web-mapping][1] tools, I&#8217;ve found [IOD][2], from the [highly weird] people at [Backspace.org][3]. The interface is obscure and CAD-like, but the results are exhaustively phenomenal. Consider this: IOD crawls a site for all its links, plots them, then crawls each plotted link for links, plots them, then plots all links off those links. All of this information is then accessible through an interactive map. A partial map of Unxmaal.com is <a target="_top" href="javascript:openScript('images/unxmap.gif',400,288)">here</a>; with the original URL highlighted in red. 

For the less adventurous, check out the [Inventix Internet Cartographer][4].
