<A HREF="http://www.infoceptor.net/article/itemhunter2.shtml">These kids</A> have the perfect summer job: they&#8217;re netting $4000 a week by selling items they&#8217;ve found while playing [Diablo 2][1] online. That&#8217;s right, they&#8217;re selling imaginary items, software codes, for real cash via [eBay][2]. What I think is beautiful is that this is truly as close as you can get to real-life dungeon crawling. These kids slog through virtual dungeons, recover treasure, and sell it at the market, just like I did back in the AD&D days. 

What upsets me, though, is that I just found a circlet on eBay that sold for $40 &#8212; the same circlet I dumped to save room in my inventory.
