Megan and I really like the Coca-Cola from McDonald&#8217;s. Until last night, we didn&#8217;t exactly know why, but it always seems to taste better coming out of McDonald&#8217;s soft drink fountain.

So last night the cashier gave us the wrong change or something and he called the manager over to fix it. It was later in the evening, so the store was really slow &#8212; it wasn&#8217;t like we were holding up any line of people or anything. She was friendly about the correction, so Megan asked the question that unlocked our &#8220;pop&#8221; mystery: &#8220;Hey, we really like the Coke at McDonald&#8217;s. Is there something you guys to do make it so good?&#8221; The manager teased us about not being able to disclose it, trade secret and whatnot, but she eventually told us&#8230;

They pre-chill the syrup before it gets mixed and dispensed &#8212; so straight from the fountain, with no ice, your soft drink is already quite cold. At other restaurants, room temperature soft drink mixed with a cup of ice is instant-watered-down-Coke. But at MickeyD&#8217;s, it&#8217;s perfect. Every time.

Now I want one at the house. =]
