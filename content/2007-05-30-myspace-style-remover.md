MySpace: where good webdesign went to die. When Tripod was still around, I thought we&#8217;d seen the worst that amateur &#8220;web designers&#8221; could inflict on the web. Boy, was I wrong.

Luckily, this [Greasemonkey MySpace Style Remover][1] script quietly cleans MySpace pages of their screeching embedded emo music, their 90 hot-linked animated photo albums, their 2MB .bmp background images, and reduces them to the boring, quiet, ugly MySpace default.
