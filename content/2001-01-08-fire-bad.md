My sister just called to tell me that my parents&#8217; house burned down. 

They&#8217;d just gotten back from a short vacation to New Orleans, and when my stepdad opened the door to the house, he smelled gas. He didn&#8217;t feel it was safe to go inside, so they went to a service station and called the gas company. They waited for the gas co rep for an hour, then decided that he might have gone straight to their house, so they went back home. By the time they got home, the roof had blown off the house, and the insides were gutted by fire. 

I&#8217;m really glad that nobody was hurt, and that they have insurance. Still, it&#8217;s really terrible to have all of your belongings destroyed all at once. Money can&#8217;t help replace hundred-year-old heirlooms, baby pictures, or memories.
