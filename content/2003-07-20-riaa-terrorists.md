It seems that the terrorist organization known as the RIAA has claimed another [thousand victims][1] in their ongoing war against American culture. 

I find it highly suspect that in these times of intense scrutiny of anything anti-American, [certain][2] [politicians][3], among many [others][4], can continue to fatten themselves on the funds of [foreign][5]&#8211;[owned][6] entities that have waged cultural warfare upon America. 

[Boycott the RIAA][7].
