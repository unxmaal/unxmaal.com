Yay! For Income Tax Return Day, Heather got me a Balt [Seatflex][1] office chair.  
I sit in one of these most of the day at work, and they&#8217;re awesome. The bungee-cord-like seat material provides great support, and since there&#8217;s not a lot of it, the seat doesn&#8217;t get hot or uncomfortable.

Thanks, Heather!
