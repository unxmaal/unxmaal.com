Some browsers don&#8217;t just suck, they suck <A HREF="http://www.webstandards.org/upgrade/tips.html">profoundly</A>. 

This page is mainly a bookmarks-folder for me, and I use IE5.5, because it&#8217;s the best browser around right now. I think it&#8217;s really neat that other people read this page, so I&#8217;ll fix obvious problems that prevent them from reading it. However, I&#8217;m not going to go out of my way to ensure that you, with your Netscape 3.0, on your 386, will be able to read this page. If I were selling widgets, and really needed your business, I would probably do something to accommodate your blatant attempt to live in the past. However, I&#8217;m not selling anything, and I don&#8217;t even run ads on this page, so I&#8217;m not overly concerned with making my site readable to blind Hungarians on their TRS-80 braille web-readers. If it means that much to you, send me some money, and use the super-leet [low-bandwidth][1] page. 

Actually, send me some money anyway. Or some action.
