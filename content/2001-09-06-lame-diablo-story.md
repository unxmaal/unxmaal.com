This one time, on [Battlenet][1]&#8230;

Last night I helped Robert build a new character for [Diablo 2][2]. So that he could get past the Normal difficulty level quickly, I went in and killed all the bosses for each Act, but let him stand in the room with me so he could gain the quest item. Now, Robert&#8217;s character is &#8220;Slayer Big_Mistake, the Level 2 Druid.&#8221; 

Just for kicks, he went to some Nightmare-difficulty PlayerKiller dueling games and started taunting people. He&#8217;d run around, threatening to &#8220;kick their asses&#8221;, and they couldn&#8217;t touch him because characters must be at least level 9 to duel. 

**Slayer Big_Mistake** (level 2): &#8220;Anyone wanna duel? I&#8217;ll take all of you on!&#8221;  
**PKDeathKiller** (level 79): &#8220;Oh really?&#8221;  
**Slayer Big_Mistake**: &#8220;Yea! Bring it on!&#8221;  
Slayer Big_Mistake was slain by Quill Rat.
