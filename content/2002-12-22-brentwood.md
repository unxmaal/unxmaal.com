While I was on vacation last week, rather than go to the beach, or skiing, or even doing something fun like eating Japanese candy [wait, I _did_ do that], I bought a [house][1]. 

In the strictest sense of the term, I didn&#8217;t really _buy_ it. The bank bought it, and I just leased my shrivelled, blackened little soul to them for thirty years in order to stay there. And it&#8217;s still not officially _mine_ yet, as I have to wait until the end of January for closing.
