[Here][1]&#8216;s some instructions for setting up your own fake [.Mac][2], on your own server, using WebDAV.

I wouldn&#8217;t set this up on an externally-reachable server, of course, but it would be nice to have on an internal corporate LAN. Shared calendars using either iCal or [Mozilla&#8217;s Calendar][3] would be a nice thing to have.
