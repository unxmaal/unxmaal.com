My assessment of this whole &#8220;[IT/Ginger][1]&#8221; media hoopla is thus: 

Kamen has a [history][2] of inventing great things that _should exist_ and don&#8217;t, not because some thinktank decided that they should be invented, but because they really _should_ exist. Based on everything I&#8217;ve read so far (twenty webpages or so), my guess is that Kamen&#8217;s come up with a cheap, fuel-efficient, non-polluting, self-stabilizing personal [walker][3].
