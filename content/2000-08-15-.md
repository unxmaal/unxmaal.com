**Son of Update!**

I&#8217;ve gone through and fixed a few more things, such as the vertical alignment on subpages (like the About page). I corrected the way internal pages open, so the links in the System box now open in the main window. I&#8217;ve also changed the php script to serve up dynamically-generated pages. Now, when you click the links in the System, Archives, and Music boxes, you&#8217;re sending a query to the server, which serves up different center boxes based on your query. How cool is that?

  Thanks to Rod for making the script in the first place. I shall never be as L337 as he.</p>
