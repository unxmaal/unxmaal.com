When you get a bunch of geeks together for a weekend of gaming and debauchery, you usually end up with some pretty terrifying memetic results. 

This weekend&#8217;s new concepts:

>   * **[Wood Blinds][1]**: I noticed a sign, while driving through Atlanta, that said &#8220;Wood Blinds.&#8221; At first I thought, &#8220;Advertisement for window coverings.&#8221; Then I thought, hey, what if this is really a public service announcement, as in &#8220;Drugs Kill&#8221; ? Maybe these people are trying to do us a favor: Wood blinds! I relayed this epiphany to the group, and they concurred that there were many ways that wood could blind. Splinters, flying sticks, and even chopsticks can rob hapless children of their sight. Remember, kids: **<blink>Wood Blinds</blink>**. 
>       * **Kayvan**: Kayvan&#8217;s name sounds like a unit of measurement. &#8220;Captain, the Amphilons are at 3500 Kayvans and closing!&#8221; We&#8217;re not sure, but we think that Kayvan is about six feet tall. If Kayvan is six feet tall, how far away is Huntsville from Atlanta, in Kayvans? Answer: a little over two Megavans, which is a _bunch_ of Kayvans. And you know what to do with a buncha Kayvans. </blockquote>
