[Beth][1] wrote to tell me that since she and her family are moving away from bucolic town of Boaz, Alabama, to greener, more urban pastures, they need to find a good home for their family cow, [Sally][2]. If you&#8217;re within driving distance, have a cattle trailer, and you have a good home for Sally [this means you won&#8217;t turn her into hamburger], please let [Beth][3] know.
