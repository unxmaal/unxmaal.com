I&#8217;ve had some fun playing with the most recent [Knoppix][1] Live-CD. It&#8217;s a &#8220;live&#8221; Linux installation on a bootable CD-Rom. 

I download the image, burned it to disc, and booted off of it. It autodetected all my hardware and network settings, so within a few minutes I had a very useable desktop, including Mozilla, Gaim, and OpenOffice. 

To be fair, my Knoppix session crashed/hung after a few hours, but since it&#8217;s all on CD, there&#8217;s not much chance for damage. 

This is a nice way to &#8220;show someone Linux&#8221;, and it&#8217;s also useful as a recovery CD, or as an emergency &#8220;must get online to download fixes for this broken/infected WinXP machine&#8221; CD. 

If you&#8217;ve not used Linux and you&#8217;re interested, this is a good way to try it out. The LiveCD method puts you in a nice &#8220;sandbox&#8221;, so you can&#8217;t break your existing OS/installation unless you try very hard. 

The new 3.2 supposedly supports &#8220;persistent home directories&#8221;, which lets you save your Knoppix config info on some mounted volume, but I haven&#8217;t tried this yet.
