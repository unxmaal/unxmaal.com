[Sam][1] introduced me to [Firestarter FX][2], which is a nice little CD-burning app for OSX. 

It supports the following features:

Backs up CDs that neither Apple&#8217;s Disc-Copy nor Roxio Toast can backup.  
iso and cue/bin support.  
Overburning.  
iso and cue/bin image creation.  
2-click folder backup.  
2-click CDRW erase.  
Simulation.  
Customizable RAM cache.  
High speed burning.  
Buffer under-run technology.  
Multi-session burning.  
Paranoia audio-cd ripping, for best error protection copy.  
CDDB access to automatically create CD-TEXT data.  
CD-TEXT reading and writing with drives that support it.

And all this for the low, low price of zero.
