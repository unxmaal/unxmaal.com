A while back, I had an idea about how to keep thieves from stealing my CD player: Craptastic Faceplates (R)(TM). 

The Craptastic Faceplate would look just like the front of an old beat-up 8-track player, a [Radio Shack][1] AM/FM-only receiver, or best of all, a Sparkomatic tape deck with one knob missing. They would be completely non-functional, but would fit the faceplate slots for most high-end car stereos. That way you could easily swap out the real faceplate with the decoy when you had to park your car in some unsavory neighborhood [like where [Robert][2] lives]. 

Either thieves would pass up stealing your ugly, Craptastic (R)(TM) radio, or there&#8217;d be a huge glut of broken old Sparkomatic or Radio Trash car stereos at the local scummy pawn shops.
