One of the drawbacks of having a transparent [Apple Pro keyboard][1] is that when a bug somehow crawls into the shell of the keyboard, you can see it, twitching. The bug, not the keyboard. 

After a few minutes of banging and futile attempts at debugging my keyboard [HA!], I&#8217;m left with a very dead and very visible bug, right there, in my keyboard.

I could [disassemble][2] the keyboard and remove the insect, but in some small way I find it grimly satisfying, as if my keyboard is some horrible machine that feeds upon the souls of dead insects.
