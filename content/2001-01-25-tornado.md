My quest for more information goes running off in the weeds again, and tonight I&#8217;ve gotten an itch for more information about tornados. 

I&#8217;ve lived in Alabama all my life, so tornados are something that I&#8217;ve come to accept. For some reason, a random trivium bubbled up into consciousness tonight that North America experiences something like 80% of the world&#8217;s tornados. For you Alabama readers, think about that: there are people who&#8217;ve never had to duck and cover in school, who&#8217;ve never sat in basements wondering if their houses are ok, who&#8217;ve never had to wait through obnoxious tornado drills. Of course, I suppose the same could be said about Alabamians and not worrying about air raids. 

Interestingly enough, last year a Huntsville-based company, [EAI][1], introduced a<A HREF="http://eai.home.mindspring.com/~eai/EAIprs02.html">seismic tornado detector</A>. Also on their site is a nice [map][2] that shows tornado probability for Alabama [note that Huntsville is Bright Red, eek!], and a screenshot of their tornado-tracking software that shows recent tornado tracks and [touchdowns][3].
