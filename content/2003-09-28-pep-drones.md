Needing tires, we stopped at [Pep-Boys][1] on Cobb Parkway. We went in through the service entrance, and stood in line for ten minutes. When we finally got to the counter, the desk clerk said, &#8220;We can&#8217;t do tires here. You have to go into the store and go all the way to the back.&#8221; Great. 

We went to the back of the store, and waited at the counter for several minutes. An employee saw us and said, &#8220;You&#8217;re here for tires? You can&#8217;t get tires here. You have to go to that counter over there.&#8221; So we walked to the next counter. And waited. A few minutes later, a guy who had been chatting with one of one of the employees noticed us standing at the counter, and nudged the employee. The employee, &#8220;Jon&#8221;, came over to the desk. 

&#8220;Tires?&#8221;  
&#8220;Yes, for a &#8217;99 Sentra.&#8221;  
&#8220;What size?&#8221;  
&#8220;We don&#8217;t know. Can&#8217;t you look that up?&#8221;  
&#8220;No, you&#8217;ve gotta have the tire size.&#8221; 

So we had to go out of the store, back to the car, and then write down all the numbers. After half an hour of hassle, we finally got the key handed over and a price quote. 

A few hours later, we went back to pick up the car. Again, the service desk guy couldn&#8217;t help us. He could give us the paperwork, but couldn&#8217;t complete the transaction. &#8220;You have to go to the front desk for that.&#8221; 

We stood in line for another five minutes or so, and finally paid the bill. When the cashier handed me the key, I asked her where the car was. &#8220;If it&#8217;s not out front, it may be around by the side.&#8221; I&#8217;m so glad she could pinpoint that for me.

Once we got to the car, I noticed there were no valve stem covers. We went back in and told the service desk clerk, who grabbed some and put them on for us. I&#8217;m very impressed with this overwhelming attention to detail, and this fills me with great hope for the oil change they also performed today.
