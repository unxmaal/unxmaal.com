So, the corpse-eating Nazis at [AOL][1] have blocked [Trillian][2] users again, only this time with a highly snotty message:

<tt>AOL Instant Messenger: You have been disconnected from the AOL Instant Message Service (SM) for accessing the AOL network using unauthorized software. You can download a FREE, fully featured, and authorized client, here http:// www.aol.com/aim/download2.html </tt>.

Since I would really like to be able to message people who will never change to another IM service, I&#8217;m yet again forced to using AOL&#8217;s craptastic client. However, I&#8217;m happy to say that I won&#8217;t be forced to look at AOL&#8217;s stupid ads, since I&#8217;m also using [DeadAIM][3].
