Eventually, I&#8217;m getting new glasses. I say eventually because the people at America&#8217;s Best Eyeglasses don&#8217;t seem very interested in common mammalian traits such as moving, breathing, or completing orders in a timely fashion. In the meantime, I&#8217;ve been reading more about the <A title="Everything you never wanted to know about SMAs" HREF="http://www.sma-inc.com/SMAPaper.html">shape memory alloys</A> that my frames are composed of. Be careful with that article, kids. It&#8217;s pretty dense.
