On June 30th, 1908, the [Tunguska Blast][1] flattened a whole lot of Siberian Taiga. On August 13, 1930, a blast at [Rio Curaca in Brazil][2] wipes out hundreds of square miles of jungle. On December 11th, 1935, a blast in the [Rupununi region of British Guiana][3] may have even been more devastating than the Tunguska Blast itself. Here is a [list][4] of impact events through history.
