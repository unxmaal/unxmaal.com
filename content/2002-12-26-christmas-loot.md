Woohoo! [Laura][1] got me good Christmas loot, including some pirate wall-plate covers (yar!), a vintage Hawaiian shirt, and a Tiki mug. She also got me the Griffin [Powermate][2], which is a very neat user-customizeable USB knob that currently acts as a scroll wheel, volume control, left-hand delete and/or enter key, and lots more, depending upon the application.
