Woot! After adding a gigabyte of RAM to my new [Mac mini][1], I&#8217;m very, very impressed with it. It&#8217;s really a very fast machine &#8212; faster than my new iBook. 

Here are the Xbench scores of my [Mac mini 1.42Ghz][2] versus my [G4/500 RAID server][3].

Note that this is **after** adding RAM. Before the RAM upgrade, the Mac mini was so horribly slow that I wanted to set it on fire. ProTip: max the RAM.
