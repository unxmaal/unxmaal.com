&#8220;We had a guy come into the hospital today, who had a fractured penis. I asked the doctor how something like that would happen. &#8220;Was he just being vigorous or did he have someone &#8220;enthusiastic&#8221; or gymnastic?&#8221;

&#8220;The doctor said it is usually (to put it delicately) caused by putting somewhere he shouldn&#8217;t be putting it. Also, a lot of people into S&M get penile fractures. Don&#8217;t ask me how; maybe somebody is bending it in weird positions.

&#8220;So don&#8217;t be putting it in a bottle or a harness or twisting it around backwards or anything cause with the blood vessels. It is hard to get it to work again.

&#8220;Sometimes the penile implants bend in weird ways and break them. You should see those things: they are big old pieces of soft hose with an end that looks like a cake decorator tip, and hard plastic side hoses that fit somewhere, AND a bulb like the nose sniffers for babies. When it&#8217;s time to use it you have to poke on your stomach to blow it up.

&#8220;I can&#8217;t figure out the optimum time to start pumping up the goober&#8230; I mean putting on a condom is intrusive&#8230; how would you go about poking on the bulb in your groin to crank up the works?

&#8220;Can you picture the whole scenario? &#8220;Just a second, honeybunch, while I inflate&#8221;? 

&#8220;Could you just roll over and do it clandestinely? How do you let the air out? Is it like a float? Or if you go too fast do you do like a balloon and fly around the room?

&#8220;How romantic.&#8221;
