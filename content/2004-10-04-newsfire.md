Wow! Holy crap! In a hat! 

I&#8217;ve been using NetNewsWire Lite for reading RSS feeds for the last several months [and if you don&#8217;t use a RSS feed-reader, please crawl out from under your rock and smell the sunlight] and though I&#8217;ve had no real problems with the application, I&#8217;ve not looked for other RSS readers either. 

Today, though, I discovered [NewsFire][1]. Holy crap, this thing is cool. The UI is very slick and very easy to use, with good, intuitive keyboard shortcuts, and the whole app is very integrated into the OS. You can easily import your old RSS bookmarks, and you can instruct the app to &#8220;discover feeds&#8221; for a given site, or even the site currently displayed in Safari. 

Go get it now!
