Relive the best parts of your childhood with [SASS][1], the Speak & Spell Simulator! 

The Speak & Spell always creeped me out a little, as a kid, because there was a certain mode that wouldn&#8217;t allow you to turn the machine off, so you had to resort to pulling out the batteries and listening to its little alien voice fade away. 

Props to [Daniel][2] for the link.
