Tim Burton: &#8220;The printed word <A HREF="http://us.imdb.com/PeopleNews/2001/20010727.html">destroys lives</A>.&#8221; 

In Tim&#8217;s world, the Internet is run by evil &#8220;negative thinkers&#8221; out to destroy humanity. How quaint.

Why do people still listen to what &#8216;famous&#8217; people have to say? Tim Burton may be a great director, but that does not implicitly guarantee him the background and education to make sweeping statements about anything outside his field of expertise. 

Fame does not equal genius, as we see cases like Rosie O&#8217;Donnell. I remember the drama majors from high school and college: they were usually the ones too self-obsessed or insipid to absorb any real knowledge, seeking instead to reproduce the work of others onstage for their own gratification. [ The only exception to this was Caroline Duncan, who _was_ a genius, and an actress, and who now works on Broadway.] 

The true shame in this is that, indeed, halfwits have seized the microphone and are screaming inanities, and the people who actually _do_ work are &#8230; busy working.
