I always thought that the little lines cut into the pavement before stoplights were pressure plates. They&#8217;re actually [inductance loops][1]. Inductance is the property of a wire or circuit element to &#8221;induce&#8221; currents in an isolated but adjacent conductive media. When a vehicle stops on or passes over the loop, the inductance of the loop is decreased, indicating the presence or passage of a vehicle.
