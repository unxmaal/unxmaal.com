I&#8217;m really excited about the upcoming [Lord of the Rings][1] movies. I&#8217;m hoping they don&#8217;t suck as badly assome<a /> of the others</a> I&#8217;ve anticipated did.  


  
According to a very good [article][2] on [Wired][3], Weta Digital<a />, the company responsible for the digital effects for LotR, has started building a wall of machines with the sole function of rendering the Lord of the Rings images. So far Jon Labrie, chief technical officer at Weta, has purchased 16 dual-processor SGI</a> 1200 servers running [Red Hat][4] Linux. By the time the films are finished &#8212; the first one is due out by the end of 2001 &#8212; Weta will have 200 processors dedicated to rendering. </p>
