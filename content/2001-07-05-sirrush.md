In 1902, German archaeologist [Robert Koldewey][1] unearthed the fabled  [Ishtar Gate][2] in the ruins of Babylon. The gateway was decorated with bas-reliefs depicting three animals, a lion, a wild oxen, and one mythical creature: the [Sirrush][3]. 

The Sirrush [Mushrushu] was described as having _a slender body covered with scales, a long slender scaly tail, and a long slim scaly neck bearing a serpent&#8217;s head &#8230; [from the mouth] a long forked tongue protrudes. There are flaps of skin attached to the back of the head, which is adorned (and armed) with a straight horn_.
