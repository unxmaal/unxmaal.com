<A HREF="http://www.marketingprofs.com/emarketing/silencesell.asp">&#8220;Opt-out marketing programs are an admission by marketers that they realize no one is listening &#8211; so they&#8217;ll just take the silence to mean a sale.&#8221;</A>

I, personally, will hunt down and scalp any defective waste of human flesh that automagically signs me up for anything I did not first request. This includes publishing all information about them, their children, their dietary habits, and other bits of info on many public forums. The same goes for telemarketers, even though we know that they are not even human.
