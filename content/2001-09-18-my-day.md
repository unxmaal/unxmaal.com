_Beth_: So, how&#8217;s your day?

_Me_: Well, a million halfwits too stupid to breathe were nominated to be &#8220;system administrators&#8221; by other halfwits too stupid to digest solid food. The first group of halfwits installed some Microsoft web-server software [built by another, different group of halfwits], didn&#8217;t secure it, and each of their servers got infected by a worm that made the servers spew out tons of useless data across the Internet. The first group of halfwits then calls me to bitch about &#8220;WHY IS UR INTARNET SLOW?!1. IT IS uR cOMPANee. TRAYING TO MAEK MAH INERNEET SLAW!!!11&#8221;. Then they try to cancel their service with my company, even though they aren&#8217;t customers. 

_Beth_:Oh, I can top that.

_Me_: Yeah? You forgot how to breathe and someone wearing a colostomy bag made you sysadmin?
