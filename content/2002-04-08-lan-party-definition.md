For the uninitiated, here&#8217;s a [definition][1] of the term &#8220;LAN Party&#8221;: &#8220;_an event where people interested in multi player computer network games bring their computers to a location, hook them together via networking equipment, and play games for hours at a time_.&#8221; 

The event at Michael&#8217;s on Saturday night was nowhere near as large as those pictured on linked site, but there was about twelve guests, much Xbox playing, much pool, and the consuming of large quantities of beer and chips.
