How you can tell that &#8216;Unxmaal&#8217; is [Evil][1]:

<pre>U   N   X   M   A   A   L

  85  78  88  77  65  65  76     - as ASCII values

   4   6   7   5   2   2   4     - digits added

  \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \<U></U><U></U>_/

   4   6   7   5   8             - digits added

Thus, "unxmaal" is 46758.

Turn the number backwards, and add 1986 &#8211; the year a postman in Okhlahoma gone postal, killing 14. The number is now 87750.

Turn the number backwards, and add 1939 &#8211; the year WW II started. The number is now 7717.

Turn the number backwards, multiply by 3 &#8211; the symbol of fulfillment. The number is now 21531.

Turn the number backwards, and add 1912 &#8211; the year Theodore Roosevelt was shot. The number is now 15424.

Subtract 8691 from the number &#8211; this is the year Martin Luther King was shot to death, written backwards. It gives 6733.

This, when read backwards, gives 3376. This is 1790 in octal, the year US patent system was established (eevil)&#8230;

**Evil, QED.**
