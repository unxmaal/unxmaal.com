[Daniel][1] says [Doom 3][2] is great. 

I disagree. I&#8217;ve been playing [City of Heroes][3], and I&#8217;m convinced COH is the better game. 

In singleplayer Doom3, you play alone. In COH, you can play alone, but you get the best gameplay experience playing in a group. 

Doom3 is very predictable, with the same monsters spawning in the same places at the same time, every time. COH missions _can_ be linear, in that certain bosses will always appear in certain missions, but in general the mobs are different every time. 

Doom3&#8217;s story line and gameplay is very linear &#8212; there is one exit; get to it. COH is very open-ended &#8212; there is no set way to play, and there are many ways to achieve goals. 

When you die in Doom3, you have to reload from a save. This seems to cheapen the experience for me, since there&#8217;s no penalty for doing something stupid. &#8220;What happens if I shoot this barrel while standing on it?&#8221; In COH, death is much less of a stumbling block. At worst, you wake up in the hospital. However, you&#8217;re penalized XP, so you have to work for a while regaining that lost XP. At higher levels, going into &#8220;XP Debt&#8221; is a very good incentive to try to stay alive.

My other gripes about both games are: I don&#8217;t like that COH forces you to pay for the game, then for monthly fees. I guess that&#8217;s what it takes to keep the developer releasing updates and expansions on what seems to be a tri-weekly basis. 

Doom3&#8217;s environment is basically: scared. You&#8217;re running through what seems to be the same industrial level for hours on end, in what the game developers intended to be &#8220;edge-of-seat panic&#8221;. Unfortunately for them, humans can get used to anything. After about the first half-hour of &#8220;OMGWTF?!!&#8221;, I just got used to it. &#8220;Creeaak.. THUMP!&#8221; &#8220;Great. Demon at 6 o&#8217;clock. Boom. Next.&#8221; 

My prediction: Doom3 will end up rotting alongside of FarCry on my hard drive. I&#8217;ll get to a point where I&#8217;ve reloaded the same quicksave ten times, get frustrated, drop to console, and type &#8216;God&#8217;. I&#8217;ll play as an invincible deity for another hour or so, and then I&#8217;ll just lose interest.

Meanwhile, my [COH character][4] will continue to go up in levels.
