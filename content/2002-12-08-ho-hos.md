When Robert was in tech-support, every day, to amuse himself, he&#8217;d try to come up with a Star Wars term to mix into the tech jargon he told to customers. The trick was to say the term without the customer noticing. &#8220;Hmm, the THX-1138 could be failing.&#8221;

He eventually decided that &#8220;Darth Vader&#8221; would be the highest-scoring term used in a tech-support conversation. &#8220;This circuit is really messed up &#8230; looks like Darth Vader got ahold of it.&#8221;

He told [James][1] about it. James decided to try it, but he would use the term &#8220;Ho-Ho&#8221;, because of a certain incident at Wal-Mart involving a cashier and the tasty treats.

One afternoon, as James was working with a customer, he had his chance. &#8220;Ok, it looks like your device doesn&#8217;t have power. Take the power adapter, the Ho-Ho, and plug it into the wall.&#8221;

&#8220;Ok, I&#8217;ve got the Ho-Ho plugged into the wall,&#8221; the lady said.

James had to put her on hold, so she wouldn&#8217;t hear him laughing. 

And the best part is, we all know that from now on, she will call a power adapter a &#8220;Ho-Ho.&#8221;
