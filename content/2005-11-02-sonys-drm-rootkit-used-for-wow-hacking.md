By now all three of you who read this site are familiar with the [tale][1] of how Sony released a music cd (by Van Zant, some crap country band) that includes a DRM rootkit.

What you _don&#8217;t_ know is that certain [enterprising][2] World of Warcraft hackers have used this nice, working [Ring0][3] rootkit to hide their nasty WoW cheating programs from Blizzard&#8217;s &#8220;[Warden][4]&#8221; cheat detection processes.
