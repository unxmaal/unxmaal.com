(Regarding that stupid [Boston/ATHF Terror Skeer][1] thing.)  
And here&#8217;s how: &#8220;The General Laws of Massachusetts, which makes it a crime to place a &#8220;hoax device&#8221; with the intent to panic the public.&#8221;

So, in the phrase &#8216;hoax device&#8217;, where &#8216;device&#8217; meaning &#8216;something that does something&#8217; and &#8216;hoax&#8217; meaning &#8216;doesn&#8217;t really&#8217;, &#8216;hoax device&#8217; must mean &#8216;something that doesn&#8217;t do what one assumes it must do&#8217;.

In Massachussets, everything that isn&#8217;t a bomb might just be a hoax device! I can imagine the state of willy-shrinking fear the MA government is experiencing right now. Boston&#8217;s chief of police is probably curled into a fetal ball behind his desk right now, convinced that since the pizza on his desk isn&#8217;t ticking, it must be part of a TERIST plot to OVATHOW the GUBMIT.

Think about that. Everything in MA is an Illegal Terrorist Implement of Terrifying Terror! &#8220;Put down the sub sandwich device, and come out with your hands up!&#8221;

Worse, the absence of objects on, near, under, or inside one&#8217;s person most certainly proves that you&#8217;re up to something!
