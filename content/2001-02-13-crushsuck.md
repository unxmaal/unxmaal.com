A special fork-in-the-eye for whichever nimrod that signed me up for <A HREF="http://www.crushlink.com/index.php3">CrushSuck</A>. It sounds nice, at first, and only after running the gauntlet of their signup procedure do you realize that it&#8217;s a cleverly disguised spam-harvester. 

That&#8217;s ok; if I notice any increase in spam, or I don&#8217;t get confirmation of their removal of my email address, I&#8217;ll have [Rackspace][1] halt their service due to violation of [TOS][2].
