[NASA World Wind][1] is a truly excellent Open Source, free 3-D world viewer, incorporating multiple layers of satellite imagery and topo data, as well as place names, boundaries, and geographic features. The mouse-driven interface lets you zoom, tilt, and pan the globe, giving the user a &#8216;fly-through&#8217; effect from the 3-D-mapped ortho-rectified imagery. It&#8217;s a pretty big download at 256MB, and it does auto-download more content if you request it to, but it&#8217;s well worth it.
