I&#8217;m sure this is old news [I&#8217;m finding articles as old as 2002] but in reading the info for Apple&#8217;s latest [Security Update][1], I noticed that in most of the security fixes, Apple gives the discoverer credit for finding and reporting the problem. 

That&#8217;s a lot nicer than suing the whistleblower.
