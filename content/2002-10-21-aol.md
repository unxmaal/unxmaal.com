It&#8217;s hard to be an addict.

While on vacation a few weeks ago, I signed up for an AOL dialup account so that Laura and I could suckle from the Internet&#8217;s great digital teat. Since I no longer need the account, I decided to cancel it today. This should&#8217;ve been easy. Instead, it&#8217;s very similar to cancelling a membership to a nation-wide gym. 

First, it is quite impossible to find any customer-service contact number via their external website, [www.aol.com][1]. I suppose they never planned on people having alternate connectivity. I actually had to ask someone who used AOL to locate the number for the Cancellation Hotline, which in turn was very well-hidden. 

Second, AOL seems to hire ex-KGB interrogation experts to act as telephone reps for the Cancellation Hotline. Mine was &#8216;Mike&#8217;. I&#8217;m pretty sure &#8216;Mike&#8217; is short for &#8216;Mikhail&#8217;. 

Me: &#8220;I need to cancel this account.&#8221;

Mike: &#8220;Ok, I&#8217;ll need your name&#8230;&#8221;

I give him my name.

Mike: &#8220;May I call you Eric?&#8221;

Me: &#8220;Sure.&#8221;

Mike: &#8220;Ok, Eric, I&#8217;ll need to get some more information from you. What&#8217;s your current phone number? Your street address? Your date of birth? Your shoe-size? Date you lost your virginity? Vas it good? Do you ever have impure thoughts about your mother? Tell me. I have vays to make you talk.&#8221;

Me: &#8220;Just cancel the account, Mike.&#8221;

Mike: &#8220;Ok, why do you want to cancel the account?&#8221;

Me: &#8220;It didn&#8217;t meet my business needs.&#8221;

Mike: &#8220;What kind of business needs?&#8221;

Me: &#8220;I&#8217;d rather not say.&#8221;

Mike: &#8220;Of course you can tell me, comrade! We have to know how vee didn&#8217;t meet your needs, so vee can be gettink da betters!&#8221;

Me: &#8220;Ok, the main reason I&#8217;m cancelling AOL is that the cancellation process is extremely invasive and irritating!&#8221;

Mike: &#8220;Hmph! Capitalist pig! Your cancellation number is 0032671614. And don&#8217;t expect me to be helpink you when dey have you in de gulag, Yankee.&#8221;
