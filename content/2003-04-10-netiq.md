I find it interesting [and highly suspect] that the RIAA is [suing][1] a college kid for billions of dollars &#8212; money he will _never_ be able to repay &#8212; when there are bigger, meatier targets available.

For years, [NetIQ][2] has had a product called [MP3Check][3]. MP3Check does just what Dan Pheng&#8217;s &#8220;wake&#8221; application did: it indexes a LAN and lists all the available MP3s. 

So why isn&#8217;t the RIAA suing NetIQ for billions?

Oh, right. NetIQ is a [Microsoft Partner][4].
