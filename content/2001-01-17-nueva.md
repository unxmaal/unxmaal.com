The [Nueva Extraterrestrial Project][1] was the &#8220;culmination of the [Nueva][2] sixth and seventh grade science classes&#8217; physiology unit in 1998-99.&#8221;

The kids created three different science-fictional planets, then populated those planets with creatures that filled appropriate ecological niches. 

My favorite creature? The Europan [Devil&#8217;s Minion][3].
