This is just kinda &#8230;weird.. yet poignant in a geekish way: my site has been surveyed by [Netcraft][1]. 

In the five years that I&#8217;ve had a computer, and worked in some relation to the IT industry, I&#8217;ve always kept an eye on the Netcraft surveys. Netcraft has always been there, like some mythical entity that I heard about, but never experienced. Today, though, I&#8217;m definitely a part of something. Sure, I&#8217;m one of over 21 million parts, but I&#8217;m still a part of Netcraft. Yeah, this means zilch to you, with your big site and a million visits a day, but to me, with my meager 80 visits a day, it&#8217;s bigtime. 

Vegas baby. Vegas.
