It really isn&#8217;t [Mapquest][1]&#8216;s fault that their maps are wrong. Last night, looking up directions to a business, I discovered that [Interstate North Parkway SE][2] splits, but retains the same name. No kidding. Looking at the map, you&#8217;d think that Interstate North Parkway SE would become Leland Dr SE. However, this is Atlanta. Interstate North Parkway SE goes straight, and it also veers off to the northeast. 

In a few months the city will probably rename both roads to &#8220;Interpeachtreestate Parkway North South Peach Circle Lane Way NE/SW&#8221;. Because Atlanta really needs more roads named Peach-something.

&#8220;Better rename some more roads! These people MIGHT forget that Georgia&#8217;s famed for its beaches.&#8221;

&#8220;Right, I&#8217;ll get on that.&#8221;

Later&#8230; 

&#8220;Wait! PEACHES!! Not beaches!!&#8221; 

&#8220;Sorry sir, but now we have 640 signs with a beach that looks like someone&#8217;s ass.&#8221;

&#8220;Oh, well, I suppose it&#8217;s better than a peach that looks like someone&#8217;s .. hey.. wait a minute..&#8221;
