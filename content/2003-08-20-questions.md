Answers to [Tara][1]&#8216;s interview questions:

_1. What&#8217;s your favorite potato dish (for example, mashed potato, loaded baked potato, scalloped, etc)?_ 

1a. Mmm, mashed taters. Mashed taters is good taters. Gotta fear them unmashed taters. They might rise up and overthrow the gubmint. They&#8217;d be dictaters then. 

_2. Describe the weirdest experience you&#8217;ve ever had while driving._

2a. Stop signs. I just noticed them last week. Really annoying. You people have put up with those things for how long?

_3. What&#8217;s funnier, cheese or corn?_ 

3a. Corn. Just think about the word. Cooorn. Say it over and over. Besides, when was the last time you&#8217;ve found cheese in your poop? And for those of you who&#8217;ve been sodomized by an angry Pepperidge Farm employee during the holiday season: though you probably deserved it, it doesn&#8217;t count.

_4. Name five songs you have in your collection that no one would expect you to have._

4a. That&#8217;s pretty unfair, since I enjoy finding the worst mp3s possible. Some of my favorites are:

The Beat Farmers &#8211; Tie My Pecker To My Leg  
Coin &#8211; Jet Pack Turbo Suit  
Blumchen &#8211; Du Und Ich  
Rasputina &#8211; Howard Hughes  
Luca Turilli &#8211; Ancient Forest of Elves

_5. What&#8217;s your favorite flavor of Jelly Belly??? jelly beans?_

I hate jelly beans. Most of them taste like earwax. If angry midgets are forcing me to eat them [the beans, not the midgets], I&#8217;d hope for lemon-flavored ones. Beans, not midgets. Although angry lemon-flavored midgets would be pretty interesting.
