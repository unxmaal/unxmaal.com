Last night, as I was leaving the Marietta Diner, I saw the [coolest car ever][1]: a 1980 Rolls Royce Silver Shadow II. It was gloss black and shiny chrome, packed full of geeks (it&#8217;s hard to miss the [Mozilla][2] &#8216;Hack&#8217; t-shirt), and had a &#8220;LINUX&#8221; license plate on the front. 

Even better? [Laura][3] said she&#8217;d buy me one for Christmas. YEE!!
