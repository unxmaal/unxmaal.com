A few days ago, Robert was telling me about this very old-school collection of text files that were very hostile and very funny. Today, I discovered that [Blort][1] has implanted telepathic monitoring probes into Robert&#8217;s head, and by monitoring our conversations, has rediscovered that collection: &#8220;<A HREF="http://www.ibft.org/">I Bleed For This?</A>&#8220;.
