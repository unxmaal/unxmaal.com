Over the weekend, I worked on installing and configuring <A HREF="http://www.cygwin.com/xfree/">Cygwin/XFree86</A>, which is a port of the [XFree86][1] software, onto my Windows laptop and workstation. This allows me to run powerful UNIX-based apps from a remote server and have them displayed locally. 

You can get the Cygwin installer [here][2]. Given about 500MB of space, this will install a fully-functional UNIX environment on your Windows system. 

Cygwin/Xfree86 comes with TWM [tiny window manager] included, but since I think it&#8217;s ugly, I recommend downloading and installing the Blackbox window manager, located [here][3].
