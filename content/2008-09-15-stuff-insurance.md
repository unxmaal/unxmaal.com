In the mad rush to consolidate two households into the smaller of two houses &#8212; and that location being hopefully only temporary &#8212; we&#8217;ve been trying to get rid of a whole lot of Stuff. 

I&#8217;ve been following a lot of the recommendations of Peter Walsh&#8217;s &#8220;[It&#8217;s All Too Much][1]&#8220;, but the biggest hurdle is dealing with the &#8220;sunk cost fallacy&#8221;, and how to get rid of those things that we &#8220;might need&#8221; in the future. 

These folks recommend selling all of the extra stuff that you don&#8217;t need _right now_, then taking that money and setting it aside for the time in the future when you _do_ need that stuff. It ends up being like a [Stuff Replacement Fund][2].
