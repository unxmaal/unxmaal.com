The <A HREF="http://www.gocho.net/overview/">Gocho</A> looks pretty neat, if you ignore the dippy name. It uses 802.11b wireless ethernet to transfer files from your PC to the car unit, which broadcasts via FM to your existing car stereo. Personally, I like the model number: &#8220;E-1337&#8221;. That&#8217;s totally k-R4d, M4n.
