&#8220;Servatus,&#8221; the server that hosts unxmaal.com, thecreep.com, omnilegent.org, and mfiles.us, has been up for over 231 days. This box is typically stable, but over the past few months things have gotten rather wonky. I&#8217;ve been meaning to rebuild this thing on FreeBSD 4.5, which I&#8217;ve been using at work for some time now. Package management under FreeBSD is much more mature than anything I&#8217;ve tried under linux, so I think I&#8217;ll generally have fewer headaches about internet services when I have one less linux box to worry about.

That said, please don&#8217;t panic if you can&#8217;t get your unx fix. Of course, you won&#8217;t be able to read this, either. =] But at least you&#8217;ll understand what happened after we&#8217;re back. Thanks for your patience.
