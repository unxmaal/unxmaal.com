I&#8217;ve found some interesting new apps for OSX:

[Fugu][1]: After months of looking for a nice, free Secure FTP client [or one that doesn&#8217;t nag the hell out of you while you&#8217;re trying it out], [Laura][2] linked me to this nice freeware front-end to the SFTP and SCP command-line apps included in OSX.

[Celestia][3]: This is a Mac OSX port of [Celestia][4], which is a free real-time planetarium that renders objects in gorgeous 3D. With it, &#8220;you can travel throughout the solar system, to any of over 100,000 stars, or even beyond the galaxy. All travel in Celestia is seamless; the exponential zoom feature lets you explore space across a huge range of scales, from galaxy clusters down to spacecraft only a few meters across.&#8221;

[Stellarium][5]: Another astronomy app that shows an earth-based view of the sky, based on your current latitude/longitude.
