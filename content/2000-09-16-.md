Yes, my children, I am alive!

After a harrowing trip inside a flying washing machine, I slept for about fourteen hours, and I&#8217;m now back to my regular vampire routine. I have several pictures for you all, such as [the beach I didn&#8217;t go to][1], the [beautiful woman I never met][2], or the [huge Hawaiian plant that decided to be my special friend][3].

Again, many special thanks to my pals Joseph and Michelle, who housed and fed me during my stay. [This][4] is a picture of the gate to the house they just bought. Yep, those are genuine 18th-century copper lions. I lust.
