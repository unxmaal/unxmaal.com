In a fit of crazed technolust, I reactivated my [Motorola Advisor Gold pager][1] this weekend. 

People ask me &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you just get a cellphone?&#8221; My answers: 

>   * You would call me. 
>       * I don&#8217;t want you to call me. 
>           * If you called me and I didn&#8217;t answer, I would have to pretend to feel guilty. 
>               * With a pager, I can easily say &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t near a phone.&#8221; Guilt-free! </p></blockquote>
