I&#8217;m revoking my [previous statement][1] about how wonderful and cool NewsFire is. 

As it turns out, NewsFire&#8217;s developer, Dave Watanabe, has decided to start charging $20 for it. My problems with this are many: 

>   * NewsFire really isn&#8217;t worth $20. It&#8217;s an RSS reader. My toilet has an RSS reader, these days. It might be worth $5. 
>       * There was never any indication that NewsFire was going to be shareware. There was just a prompt to upgrade, and a minor mention of a &#8220;registration&#8221; system in the release notes. 
>           * There&#8217;s no real improvement over the existing, working 0.62 version. 
>               * [NetNewsWire Lite][2] does the same thing, and is free. 
I&#8217;m not sure which drugs Mr. Watanabe is on. Gone are the days where a developer can give a marginally-better-than-the-competition application away for free, then arbitrarily decide to start charging for the next version. Particularly when Tiger&#8217;s version of Safari will support RSS feeds natively within a few months.
