Megan and I went shopping for eyeglasses tonight. We didn&#8217;t even leave the house &#8212; we used Megan&#8217;s spiffy new <A HREF="http://www.apple.com/ibook/">iBook</A> to wirelessly shoot a couple goofy photos of each other and upload them to <A HREF="http://www.eyeglasses.com/">eyeglasses.com</A>. Their &#8220;eTryItOn&#8221; feature is now officially the coolest interactive feature with the least creative name. Go try it &#8212; use your favorite cartoon character, even. It&#8217;s a kick.
