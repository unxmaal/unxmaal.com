Slight site modifications: I&#8217;ve moved the sites I read most often into the Prime box, and I&#8217;ve begun sorting based on clickthroughs. 

This month&#8217;s winner, with 90 clickthroughs, was <A HREF="http://www.salsgiver.com/people/huffman/blogger.html">Mary</A>. She gets a grand prize of&#8230; well&#8230; nothing. However, I did think really hard about getting her some ice cream. That&#8217;ll have to do.
