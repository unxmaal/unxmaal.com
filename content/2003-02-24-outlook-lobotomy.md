Microsoft Outlook tries to be too smart for its own good. Its willingness to execute scripts and display attachments that only-heaven-knows-who may&#8217;ve sent is the reason the world heard of the MELISSA and ILOVEYOU email worms.

If you or someone you know is forced to use this steenking pile of excuse for software, by corporate policy or otherwise, you might direct them to two ways I found to give Outlook a well-deserved lobotomy: a <A HREF="http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=307594">registry hack from Microsoft to force Outlook to display email as plain text</A>, and a <A HREF="http://www.slipstick.com/dev/code/zaphtml.htm">different solution</A> from Slipstick Systems that uses Outlook&#8217;s Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) implementation for good rather than evil.
