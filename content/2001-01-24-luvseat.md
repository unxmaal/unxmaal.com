Yet another device that fills me with fear: the <A title="This link is not Rod-safe." HREF="http://www.luvseat.com/Home.html">LuvSeat</A>. The fact that this thing exists is terrifying enough, but digging deeper into the site, you&#8217;ll find that it supports &#8220;up to 500 pounds.&#8221; Is that for one person, or two? One 100lb person, and a 400lb person? It also has accessories, such as &#8220;securely-attached steel hooks or eyes for attaching restraints.&#8221; Oh, and for you naughty weasels browsing from work, be careful scrolling down; the animated gifs are classics.
