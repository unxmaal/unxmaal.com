Way back in 1998, I got a job doing tech support for AIRnet, an ISP which serviced north Alabama. AIRnet had???? covered most of north Alabama, and was pushing farther and farther south &#8212; towards areas that didn&#8217;t know much about electricity, much less The Interwebs. 

One of the high-growth areas was Blountsville, county seat of Blount County, Alabama. Blount being the opposite of &#8216;sharp&#8217;, I suppose. 

One afternoon, the receptionist called out, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got a live one! It&#8217;s from Blountsville! Who wants it?&#8221; 

I volunteered, knowing what I was getting myself into.

&#8220;AIRnet tech support, how can I help you?&#8221;

&#8220;Yeah, I bought the internet the other day,&#8221; the woman said. (Wow, deep pockets on this one.)

&#8220;OK, ma&#8217;m, what can I help you with?&#8221; 

&#8220;Well, I can&#8217;t get on,&#8221; she said. 

&#8220;Can you be more specific,&#8221; I asked. &#8220;What happens when you try to connect?&#8221;

&#8220;Well I call that number that you give me, and it just squeals in my ear.&#8221;

Oh boy.

&#8220;Ma&#8217;m, do you _have_ a computer?&#8221; I asked.

&#8220;Why,???? hell no &#8212; that&#8217;s what I pay you people twenty dollar a month for!&#8221;

&#8220;Hold please, while I transfer you to Billing.&#8221;
