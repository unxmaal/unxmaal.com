It&#8217;s always lovely to be interrupted from one&#8217;s afternoon net-browsing by the sounds of tornadic wind and the cracking of [tree-trunks][1].

Once the wind had died down, I went outside to find one of my ancient oaks broken off a few feet up its [trunk][2], sprawled across a good portion of my back yard. It&#8217;s a good thing that [shed][3] was there to break the fall. 

A week later, and I&#8217;ve got insurance checks in hand, and am waiting for the Scary Tree Cutting Guy&trade; and the Confederate Rebel Contractor Guy&trade; to show up and start removing tree and shed bits.
