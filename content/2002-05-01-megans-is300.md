Megan and I realized that her <A HREF="http://www.edmunds.com/used/2000/pontiac/grandam/4drse1sedan/prices.html">2000 Pontiac Grand Am</A> was falling apart and losing value fast. Their recent low-interest promotions were great sales promoters but also dampened the used market, where interest rates are more typical. We didn&#8217;t want to hold on to a car that was in need of increasingly frequent repairs, and we also didn&#8217;t want to sell it and take an unreasonable equity hit. 

So she traded it in last night and got a great deal &#8212; on a <A HREF="http://www.lexus.com/showroom/model/is_sportcross.html">Lexus IS300</A>. Cool.
