Well, I&#8217;m here at LinuxWorld in San Jose. It&#8217;s very odd &#8211; this place has so much of a Comdex-marketroid-brainless-boothbabe feel to it that it&#8217;s a bit disturbing. But that&#8217;s ok. I am getting some swag, but limiting myself to what I can take on a plane. =] And, I don&#8217;t need more tshirts. Gosh knows I have plenty. 

PS: Continental Airlines can officially BITE ME. Nothing like running through Houston International, getting from gate B60 to C27 in 15 minutes. Grrrrr.
