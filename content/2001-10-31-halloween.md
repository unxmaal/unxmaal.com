Happy Halloween! 

I&#8217;m leaving tomorrow morning for a vacation in Hawaii. For my enjoyment, this 11-hour long plane flight will include the following features: it occurs on All-Saint&#8217;s Day, there are reports of increased of terrorists activity, and tonight we&#8217;re having the first [blue moon][1] since 1940.
