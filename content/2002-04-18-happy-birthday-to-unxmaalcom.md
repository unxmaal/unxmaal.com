Happy Birthday to Unxmaal.com! 

This week marks _two full years_ of regular posting on this site. 

As you can see from the first week&#8217;s <a target="_top" href="http://unxmaal.com/?blogger-backup/2000_04_16_archive.htm">archive</a>, the quality of the posts have not declined. Expect many more links to [clown sex][1], [Invader Zim][2], [Bleemcast download][3]s, and &#8230; well&#8230; any other [stupid][4], [weird][5], or just plain [wacko][6] thing that catches my eye or might attract the attention of some poor, depraved [Google][7]-searching moron [desperate][8] for a glimpse of some [women farting videos][9].
