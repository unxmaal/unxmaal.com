My first girlfriend mailed me a little stuffed hamster/beaver/thing. It was doused in her perfume, &#8216;to remember her by&#8217;, since she lived two hours away and I only got to see her every other weekend.

Twelve years later, I have no idea what became of that girl, and the beaver is now a thoroughly-masticated dog toy.

There&#8217;s a parable in there somewhere.
