<A HREF="http://www.wired.com/">Wired News</A> <A HREF="http://www.wired.com/news/who.html">Intern Danit Lidor</A> wrote <A HREF="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,52435,00.html">a sensational, one-sided story</A> about one of <A HREF="http://www.apid.com/">my employer</A>&#8216;s <A HREF="http://www.wordrecords.com/">customers</A>. I was quoted accurately, but I&#8217;m _not_ WordRecords.com&#8217;s webmaster, was not responsible for the less-than-swift marketing campaign, and didn&#8217;t know the context of his question at the time&#8230; though I know our customers regularly send out valid, non-spam mailings from double-opt-in lists. I responded to Lidor&#8217;s email as follows:
