Hooray for TLAs. 

The [Mac OSX DVD Player User Operations Prohibition][1] patch allows the user to perform actions that a DVD may regard as &#8216;prohibited&#8217;, such as skipping the ten thousand advertisements for whatever mindless drivel is being pumped out by Disney this month. 

I haven&#8217;t tried it, so if you do, let me know if it melts your Mac.
