After I read the [Epinions reviews][1] of Titan AE, I steeled myself to be underwhelmed this afternoon. 

Frankly, I have no idea what those Epinions people really wanted out of this movie. It&#8217;s a _cartoon_, people! It&#8217;s made for _kids_! Of course, being a kid, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Sure, the science was dreamed up by a high-school dropout, and the plot is run-of-the-mill sci-fi &#8220;exiles from Earth &#8212; must find home&#8221; fodder, but it is truly worth five bucks for an hour-and-a-half. I&#8217;d pay that much just to see really neato graphics; the rest was extra. 

All in all, this is a kid-pleasing sci-fi flick, with very little of the recent Disney tree-hugging sappiness <no pun intended>. And since the baddies are pure energy, we can shoot the crap out of &#8217;em all day long.
