After two days of Nyquil-induced stupor, my cold cleared up enough that I was able to drive to Atlanta for the weekend. My network connection has been spotty (rather, nonexistent). I blame this entirely on [Charter Cable][1]&#8216;s pathetically poor service. I&#8217;m hoping [Dori][2] will be able to find [another][3] cable ISP soon. 

So far, I&#8217;ve not been able to see [Hannibal][4], but I have had some awesome sushi at some Japanese place that I forget the name of.
