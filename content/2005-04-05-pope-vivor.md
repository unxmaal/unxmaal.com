Me: Damn, this is pretty harsh: &#8220;Since 1274, and the [Ubi Periculum][1] rule, cardinals are fed one meal a day during the election, and only bread and water if they haven&#8217;t decided after 5 days. They are held in complete seclusion and the recent Universi Dominici Gregis regulation forbids access to newspapers, radio or television. &#8221; 

Daniel: &#8220;Yeah. But hell, it&#8217;s kinda like Survivor: if you can outlast the other contestants in this new car, you win the car. Only this time, it&#8217;s a bigger hat.&#8221;
