[This][1] is the perfect social hack for Monday.

Tired of piles of junk mail clogging your mailbox? 

&#8220;A little-known Federal law allows individuals to send a Prohibitory Order against companies that are sending unsolicited sexually provocative or erotically arousing mail. The Supreme Court went one step further, allowing individuals to decide what constitutes &#8220;erotically arousing&#8221; mail. The law makes it illegal for a company to send mail to an individual within thirty days of receiving the Order.&#8221;

So what are you waiting for?

Print out US Postal Form [1500][2], fill it out, attach an opened piece of junk mail, and send it in. 

Read the [link][1] for detailed information. 

This makes me very happy, because I find Providian credit card offers to be highly obscene.
