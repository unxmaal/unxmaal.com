Oh my.

[Driftnet][1] is &#8220;a program which listens to network traffic and picks out images from TCP streams it observes&#8221;. In English, it listens to all traffic running across your network, finds and decodes all JPEG images that are currently being transmitted, and displays them on a pretty mosaic screen.
