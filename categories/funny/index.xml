&lt;p>“Right before you moved back to go to college, he had to attend a managers meeting in Pensacola (he &lt;em>had&lt;/em> go because it was required for them to become accredited for something or other.)

No kidding. Looking at the map, you’d think that Interstate North Parkway SE would become Leland Dr SE. However, this is Atlanta. Interstate North Parkway SE goes straight, and it also veers off to the northeast.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a few months the city will probably rename both roads to “Interpeachtreestate Parkway North South Peach Circle Lane Way NE/SW”. Because Atlanta really needs more roads named Peach-something.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Kevin’s Velociraptor</title><link>/archives/871/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jun 2003 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/871/</guid><description>&lt;p>A few weeks ago, &lt;a href="http://livejournal.com/~shadowstitch/">Kevin&lt;/a> bought a &lt;a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/shadowstitch/122260.html">wooden dinosaur model&lt;/a> for 99 cents.
