&lt;p>The exterminator asked if there was dog food left out where the rats could get to it.

His idea was to fly it back to Oregon, jack it up in the air and make a gas station out of it. He paid $15,000 for it. He asked which one was his and they said take whichever you want because there were miles of them.

&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Anything that associates Hillary Clinton with ritual murders, George Bush Sr, and cannons that look like irrigation pipes &lt;em>IN THE FIRST SENTENCE&lt;/em> is damn good reading.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>No.</title><link>/archives/1675/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Mar 2005 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/1675/</guid><description>&lt;p>Someone please call the Internet, and tell it to not let Laura find out about &lt;a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000593036018/">these&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Eeep.</title><link>/archives/976/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jul 2004 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/976/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.fotolog.net/anythinggreat/?pid=8056553" title="anythinggreat`s Fotolog">O_O&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Goonies Locations</title><link>/archives/975/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jul 2004 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/975/</guid><description>&lt;p>Here’s a list of some of the locations filmed in “&lt;a href="http://www.thegoonies.org/locations.htm" title="The Goonies">The Goonies&lt;/a>“.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tree-Top Boulders</title><link>/archives/915/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2003 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/915/</guid><description>&lt;p>Spooky.&lt;/p>
