&lt;p>I used NNW for ages, a few years ago, but switched to Google Reader after NNW started asking me for my moneys. I find that NNW’s keyboard shortcuts are a lot faster than Google Reader’s, and the general experience is better. Another nice new feature is that news subscriptions sync between multiple copies of NetNewsWire via Newsgator.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>CustomizeGoogle</title><link>/archives/1829/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Dec 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/1829/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.customizegoogle.com/">CustomizeGoogle&lt;/a> is one of my favorite Firefox (and &lt;a href="http://flock.com">Flock&lt;/a> plugins.

&lt;p>“Despite assurances from the card companies, researchers Tom Heydt-Benjamin and Kevin Fu were able to easily retrieve data from the new cards … data available without encryption and in plain text. From the article: “They could skim and store the information from a card with a device the size of a couple of paperback books, which they cobbled together from readily available computer and radio components for $150. They say they could probably make another one even smaller and cheaper: about the size of a pack of gum for less than $50. And because the cards can be read even through a wallet or an item of clothing, the security of the information, the researchers say, is startlingly weak.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pen Drive Linux</title><link>/archives/1794/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Sep 2006 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/1794/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.pendrivelinux.com/">Pen Drive Linux&lt;/a>: Boot and run Linux from a USB flash memory stick.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fixing FireFox’s Stupid.</title><link>/archives/1769/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Apr 2006 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/1769/</guid><description>&lt;p>Ever tried to send a file attachment via Gmail using FireFox, and gotten the really annoying “unresponsive script” popup every five seconds?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Tony Flynn, of The Australian National University, has &lt;a href="http://www.abc.net.au/ra/innovations/stories/s1339270.htm">developed&lt;/a> an ultra-cheap, ultra-low-tech water filter capable of removing virtually all E. Coli bacteria from a water supply.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The filter can be made from terra cotta clay mixed with coffee grounds, molded into a cup-like shape, then fired in a manure-pile. The manure will burn at temperatures of up to 700????F, which will burn away the coffee ground inclusions. The resulting pores are large enough to allow water to pass, but small enough to trap bacteria and other pollutants.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sweet bash Tricks</title><link>/archives/1698/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Apr 2005 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/1698/</guid><description>&lt;p>The O’Reilly developers have compiled a quick list of really useful &lt;a href="http://oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/6915">bash Tricks&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bastet</title><link>/archives/1697/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Apr 2005 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/1697/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://happypenguin.org/show?bastet">Bastet&lt;/a>, or “Bastard Tetris”, is pure evil, written in ncurses.

&lt;p>I use a tiered ‘mobility’ system:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tier 1 is the base station, which is my G4. I use iCal and Address Book.app on it. All data entry and long-term calendaring /corrections/should be done here. The data stored here should be held as “true”, over all systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tier 2 is the work station, which is my iBook. I use iCal and Address Book.app on it. I do almost all of my data entry here, and clean it up on the base station. The iBook is a mobile workstation, so I can lug it anywhere, change or create stuff, and eventually sync that data with the base station.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Knoppix</title><link>/archives/949/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Mar 2004 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/949/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’ve had some fun playing with the most recent &lt;a href="http://knoppix.org">Knoppix&lt;/a> Live-CD.

&lt;p>It seems to me that the better way of blocking comment spam would be to use a modified version of Realtime Blackhole Lists.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The downside of RBLs for email have been the fact that if you use them, you must rely solely upon the judgement of their maintainers. There is an implicit trust in the maintainers of the RBL, that they won’t block the entire continent of Asia just because of a few Tawainese spammers. Unfortunately, many RBL maintainers have, in the past, blocked whole major networks, just to “get attention”. This had the effect of wiping out email for enormous chunks of the Internet. Since most webloggers want to encourage commenting, this is not the result we want.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>BF1942</title><link>/archives/909/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Oct 2003 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/909/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.eagames.com/official/battlefield1942/home.jsp">Battlefield 1942&lt;/a> is yet another example of why I hate buying video games.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The reason for this is obvious after thinking about how the proxies work. The site mentions that some of these anonymize your traffic and thats true.

&lt;p>I can’t find the controllers for my poor old PSX, so I’m using an excellent PSX emulator called &lt;a href="http://www.epsxe.com/news.php">EPSXE&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The emulation is remarkably fast, and excepting a few odd glitches, the game is very playable. Movie music doesn’t seem to play, but the in-game MIDI tracks seem to play just fine, although they do slow down if the machine starts running too many tasks. EPSXE handles input from my old Microsoft Sidewinder gamepad very well, even though the gamepad is missing many of the buttons of the original PSX controller.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Spamassassin</title><link>/archives/885/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jul 2003 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/885/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://unxmaal.com/cgi-bin/clickcount.cgi?action=jump&amp;amp;URL=http://www.eschew.net/">Jimi&lt;/a> has written a nice brief &lt;a href="http://www.eschew.net/geek/spamassassin.php">tutorial&lt;/a> on installing and configuring &lt;a href="http://spamassassin.org">Spamassassin&lt;/a> on a Redhat Linux system.&lt;/p>

It runs on both Windows and OSX.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>N.A.G. (Network Auralization for Gnutella) is interactive software art for Mac OS X and Windows 2000/XP which turns the process of searching for and downloading MP3 files into a chaotic musical collage. Type in one or more search keywords, and N.A.G. looks for matches on the Gnutella peer-to-peer file sharing network. The software then downloads MP3 files which match the search keyword(s) and remixes these audio files in real time based on the structure of the Gnutella network itself.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Intermatic</title><link>/archives/868/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2003 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/868/</guid><description>&lt;p>My pool pump is powered by an ancient, rusting &lt;a href="http://www.intermatic.com/?action=prod&amp;amp;pid=376">Intermatic&lt;/a> mechanical 24-hour time switch.

&lt;p>&lt;em>Indeed, modern evolutionary theory is very respectful of the power of death. After all, in that theory it is death that prunes and directs the otherwise boundlessly chaotic, mutable explosive flow of life. Death is the mechanism of selection, death the means by which certain mutations are deemed fit to survive and be passed on to future descendants. The tension between the urge to procreate and the possibility of dying before passing one’s genetic information forward to be combined and developed is what, according to Darwin and his disciples, helped create that massively diverse biosphere in the first place. Taken still further, there are schools of thought that regard evolution as punctuated by bursts of sudden adaptation which may well be explainable as the influence of sudden drastic shifts in environment placing additional selective pressure on life…in essence, the death rate goes up because a rock falls from space or continental drift changes the climate, and as the deaths pile up the remaining life forms are pared down to a few hardy forms, which then explode into new forms as soon as the playing field is stable enough to be exploited. Whether you view life as a closed cycle that can only bear so much before necessary collapse or a fractal with the potential to expand indefinitely, it’s clear that death provides a necessary service in simultaneously producing fodder for future expansion and allowing room for new development by carving stagnation away.”&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Correct VNC Ports</title><link>/archives/850/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Mar 2003 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/850/</guid><description>&lt;p>(Because I always forget)&lt;/p>
